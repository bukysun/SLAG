This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\"",

His pioneering contributions to soul music contributed to the rise of Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Billy Preston, and popularized the likes of Otis Redding and James Brown. AllMusic biographer Bruce Eder wrote that Cooke was \"the inventor of soul music\", and possessed \"an incredible natural singing voice and a smooth, effortless delivery that has never been surpassed\". On December 11, 1964, at the age of 33, Cooke was shot and killed by Bertha Franklin, the manager of the Hacienda Motel in Los Angeles, California.

Gershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark, Henry Cowell, and Joseph Brody. He began his career as a song plugger but soon started composing Broadway theater works with his brother Ira Gershwin and with Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris intending to study with Nadia Boulanger, but she refused him. He subsequently composed \"An American in Paris\", returned to New York City and wrote \"Porgy and Bess\" with Ira and DuBose Heyward. Initially a commercial failure , it came to be considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century and an American cultural classic. Gershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous film scores. He died in 1937 of a malignant brain tumor.

Schwartz was born in Romny in the Ukrainian SSR in 1923. His family moved to Leningrad in 1930, where he learned to play the piano. He gave his first concert in 1935 with the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra. Schwartz's father was professor of archeology at the Leningrad State University: he was arrested in 1936 and executed two years later as part of the Great Purge. Schwartz's family was exiled to Kyrgyzstan in 1937, and Schwartz gave private music lessons in Frunze (now Bishkek) as well as occasionally accompanying the silent films at the cinema with live music. During the Second World War, Schwartz directed one of the sections of the Red Army Choir. During that time, he met Mariya Dmitriyevna, the sister of Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, who introduced him to her brother. Shostakovich helped Schwartz gain entry to the Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory in Leningrad, from whence he graduated with a diploma in composition in 1951. He joined the Union of Soviet Composers in 1955. Only years later did he discover that Shostakovich had paid for his education. When Shostakovich was dismissed from the Conservatory, Schwartz was asked to denounce Shostakovich, but he refused. Schwartz's first major commission was the music for the film \"Our Correspondent\" in 1959. He went on to compose the music for more than 100 Soviet films, including \"White Sun of the Desert\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0446\u0435 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043d\u0438\", 1969) and \"The Captivating Star of Happiness\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\", 1975). Perhaps his best known work outside of the Soviet Union was for Akira Kurosawa's 1975 film \"Dersu Uzala\". He won the prestigious Nika Award of the Russian Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences for 1992 for his music for the films \"White King, Red Queen\u0411\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c, \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\") and \"Luna Park\u041b\u0443\u043d\u0430-\u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\"). Schwartz also composed music for ballets and theatrical performances and, to a lesser extent, for television. His one symphony, \"Gelbe Sterne \u2013 Purimspiel im Ghetto\", was first performed in Saint Petersburg in 2000: it was inspired by the story of the Kovno Ghetto in Lithuania. Schwartz died in Siversky, near Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation, on 27 December 2009, aged 86.\"",

Raghnall's possession of his family's expansive ancestral territories in the Hebrides and West Highlands put him in conflict with the neighbouring magnate William III, Earl of Ross, and contention between the two probably contributed to Raghnall's assassination at the hands of the earl's adherents in 1346.

His \"Bashu, the Little Stranger\" (1986) was voted \"Best Iranian Film of all time\" in November 1999 by a Persian movie magazine \"Picture World\" poll of 150 Iranian critics and professionals. Still, even before the outset of his cinematic career in 1970, he was a leading playwright (as well as theater historian), so much so that he is often considered the greatest playwright of the Persian language, and holds a reputation as \"the Shakespeare of Persia.\" Since 2010, Beyzai has lived and taught at Stanford University, United States.\"",

He began singing as a child and joined the Soul Stirrers before moving to a solo career where he scored a string of hit songs like \"You Send MeA Change Is Gonna ComeWonderful WorldChain GangTwistin' the Night Away\", and \"Bring It On Home to Me\". His pioneering contributions to soul music contributed to the rise of Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Billy Preston, and popularized the likes of Otis Redding and James Brown. AllMusic biographer Bruce Eder wrote that Cooke was \"the inventor of soul music\", and possessed \"an incredible natural singing voice and a smooth, effortless delivery that has never been surpassed\". On December 11, 1964, at the age of 33, Cooke was shot and killed by Bertha Franklin, the manager of the Hacienda Motel in Los Angeles, California. After an inquest, the courts ruled Cooke's death to be a justifiable homicide. Since that time, the circumstances of his death have been called into question by Cooke's family.\"",

Before he became Prince of Orange upon the death of his eldest half-brother Philip William in 1618, he was known as Maurice of Nassau. Maurice spent his youth in Dillenburg in Nassau, and studied in Heidelberg and Leiden. He succeeded his father William the Silent as stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland in 1585, and became stadtholder of Utrecht, Guelders and Overijssel in 1590, and of Groningen in 1620. As Captain-General and Admiral of the Union, Maurice organised the Dutch rebellion against Spain into a coherent, successful revolt and won fame as a military strategist. Under his leadership and in cooperation with the Land's Advocate of Holland Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, the Dutch States Army achieved many victories and drove the Spaniards out of the north and east of the Republic. Maurice set out to revive and revise the classical doctrines of Vegetius and pioneered the new European forms of armament and drill. During the Twelve Years' Truce, a religious dispute broke out in the Republic, and a conflict erupted between Maurice and Van Oldenbarnevelt, which ended with the latter's decapitation. After the Truce, Maurice failed to achieve more military victories. He died without legitimate children in The Hague in 1625, and was succeeded by his younger half-brother Frederick Henry.\"",

Both critics and audiences favorably received the film. \" The Goose Woman\" was remade in 1933 as\" The Past of Mary Holmes\" featuring Helen MacKellar and Jean Arthur.\"",

The younger son of the Earl of Portsmouth, he briefly sat in Parliament on a family interest and later died in captivity in France during the Napoleonic Wars. Wallop was the third son of John Wallop, 2nd Earl of Portsmouth. He was educated at Eton from 1785 to 1792. On 29 April 1794, he was commissioned a captain of volunteers in the South Hampshire militia, and was given the captaincy of one of the permanent companies of the regiment on 4 April 1795. Wallop resigned his commission on 24 July 1799. Wallop was returned for Andover in 1796 on his father's electoral interest. He made little mark in Parliament and supported, at his father's direction, the Pitt ministry. However, he was apparently somewhat mentally deficient, like his eldest brother Viscount Lymington. John King, who had ambitions to enter Parliament, wrote Pitt in 1800 to say that Wallop was \"little better than an idiot\" and \"has spent all his money,\" so that his mother was willing to put up another candidate for Andover if a pension of \u00a3400 a year could be obtained for him. Pitt declined, and Wallop sat in Parliament until the next election, in 1802, when he was replaced by his elder brother Newton. On 2 April 1802, he married Catherine Townley Keatinge, the only daughter of Maurice Keatinge. He took the opportunity of the Peace of Amiens to travel to France, but was detained at Verdun when war broke out again in 1803. While there, he was alleged to have carried on an affair with the wife of another English detainee, which prompted the French authorities to remove him to the fortress of Bitche in February 1805. He was returned to Verdun in May 1806, but his health had suffered badly, and he died suddenly of apoplexy on 31 August 1807. He left no children.\"",

The film tells the story of a schizophrenic young woman (Andersson) vacationing with her family on a remote island, during which time her author father attempts to use her illness in his work, her brother experiences sexual frustration, and she experiences delusions about meeting God, who appears to her in the form of a monstrous spider. Bergman structured the film as a three-act play, drawing on his personal experiences and relationships. The film was his first of several shot on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6, at the recommendation of cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The score incorporates the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Themes explored include the equation of God with love, exploitation in art, psychosis, and sexuality. \"Through a Glass Darkly\" was released to positive reviews, specifically for Andersson's performance, and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was followed by Bergman's thematically related 1963 films \"Winter Light\" and \"The Silence\".\"",

After the premature death of both his parents, Raymond studied at a commercial academy and trained as a banker. Raymond composed operetta music as well as copious pieces for films and Schlager, which were very successful in the 1920s and 1930s and were commonly heard being sung and whistled in the streets. He became world-famous with his 1925 composition  (\"I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg\"), and his pieces were considered to be very much in the typical style of the 1920s, especially  (\"I Saw Miss Helen Bathing\") or  (\"I Lost An Eyelash\"). Due to a weak heart, he spent his military service with a propaganda company which served the Belgrade military transmitter. After the war, he took a short break from the Salzburg Radio Orchestra to go to Hamburg, where he finished his last two operettas, \"Geliebte ManuelaBeloved Manuela\") and \"Flieder aus WienLilacs from Vienna\").

Since 1978, Polanski has been a fugitive from the U.S. criminal justice system; he fled the country while awaiting sentencing in his sexual abuse case, in which he pleaded guilty to statutory rape. His Polish- Jewish parents moved the family back from Paris to Krak\u00f3w in 1937. Two years later, Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany starting World War II and the Polanskis found themselves trapped in the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto. After his mother and father were taken in raids, Polanski spent his formative years in foster homes under an adopted identity, trying to survive the Holocaust. Polanski's first feature- length film,\" Knife in the Water\"( 1962), was made in Poland and was nominated for a United States Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. He has since received five more Oscar nominations, along with two BAFTAs, four C\u00e9sars, a Golden Globe Award and the Palme d' Or of the Cannes Film Festival in France. In the United Kingdom he directed three films, beginning with\" Repulsion\"( 1965). In 1968, he moved to the United States and cemented his status by directing the horror film\" Rosemary's Baby\"( 1968). A turning point in his life took place in 1969, when his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, and four friends were brutally murdered by members of the Manson Family. Following her death, Polanski returned to Europe and eventually continued directing. He made\" Macbeth\"( 1971) in England and back in Hollywood,\" Chinatown\"( 1974), which was nominated for eleven Academy Awards. In 1977, Polanski was arrested and charged with drugging and raping a 13- year- old girl. He subsequently pled guilty to the lesser offence of unlawful sex with a minor. After spending 42 days undergoing psychiatric evaluation in prison in preparation for sentencing, Polanski, who had expected to be put on probation, fled to Paris after learning that the judge planned to reject his plea deal and impose a prison term. In Europe, Polanski continued to make films, including\" Tess\"( 1979), starring Nastassja Kinski. It won France's C\u00e9sar Awards for Best Picture and Best Director, and received three Oscars. He later produced and directed\" The Pianist\"( 2002), a drama about a Jewish- Polish musician escaping Nazi persecution, starring Adrien Brody and Emilia Fox. The film won three Academy Awards including Best Director, along with numerous international awards. He also directed\" Oliver Twist\"( 2005), a story which parallels his own life as a\" young boy attempting to triumph over adversity\". He was awarded Best Director for\" The Ghost Writer\"( 2010) at the 23rd European Film Awards. He also received Best Screenwriter nomination at the aforementioned awards for\" Carnage\"( 2011). In 2018, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voted to expel Polanski from its membership.\"",

Before his military career, Pillow practiced law and was active in Democratic Party politics. He was a floor leader in support of the nomination of fellow-Tennessean James K. Polk at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. In 1847, Pillow was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers to serve in the Mexican\u2013American War, and was later promoted to major general. He performed reasonably well, and was wounded that year at Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. However, controversy arose when, in a series of letters, Pillow tried to take what was perceived by some as undue credit for American victories at the expense of his commander, Major General Winfield Scott. Pillow was court-martialed for insubordination, but with President Polk's assistance, the court-martial was reduced to a court of inquiry, which in 1848 exonerated Pillow. After the war, Pillow served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention of 1850, where he supported compromise. He remained active in supporting the Democratic Party. At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Pillow supported secession, and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in July. Pillow received the thanks of the Confederate Congress for driving off the Union force at the Battle of Belmont, Missouri. Pillow controversially failed to exploit a temporary break through of Union lines by his troops which might have allowed the Confederate garrison of Fort Donelson to escape at the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862. The next night, before the surrender of the fort, Brigadier General John B. Floyd passed overall command of the fort to Pillow, who in turn passed it to Brigadier General Simon Buckner. Floyd and Pillow managed to personally escape with a few aides before Buckner surrendered the remaining garrison to the Union Army of Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant. These actions sent his military career and reputation into decline. Pillow commanded a brigade at the Battle of Stones River in 1863, where he performed poorly, and was among the few generals in the army to praise the leadership of commanding General Braxton Bragg. Removed from combat duty, he worked mainly in recruiting assignments through the remainder of the war. Bankrupt after the war, Pillow recovered financially and resumed a successful legal career. He died near Helena, Arkansas in 1878; initially buried in Helena, Pillow was later reinterred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.\"",

Schwartz was born in Romny in the Ukrainian SSR in 1923. His family moved to Leningrad in 1930, where he learned to play the piano. He gave his first concert in 1935 with the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra. Schwartz's father was professor of archeology at the Leningrad State University: he was arrested in 1936 and executed two years later as part of the Great Purge. Schwartz's family was exiled to Kyrgyzstan in 1937, and Schwartz gave private music lessons in Frunze (now Bishkek) as well as occasionally accompanying the silent films at the cinema with live music. During the Second World War, Schwartz directed one of the sections of the Red Army Choir. During that time, he met Mariya Dmitriyevna, the sister of Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, who introduced him to her brother. Shostakovich helped Schwartz gain entry to the Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory in Leningrad, from whence he graduated with a diploma in composition in 1951. He joined the Union of Soviet Composers in 1955. Only years later did he discover that Shostakovich had paid for his education. When Shostakovich was dismissed from the Conservatory, Schwartz was asked to denounce Shostakovich, but he refused. Schwartz's first major commission was the music for the film \"Our Correspondent\" in 1959. He went on to compose the music for more than 100 Soviet films, including \"White Sun of the Desert\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0446\u0435 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043d\u0438\", 1969) and \"The Captivating Star of Happiness\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\", 1975). Perhaps his best known work outside of the Soviet Union was for Akira Kurosawa's 1975 film \"Dersu Uzala\". He won the prestigious Nika Award of the Russian Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences for 1992 for his music for the films \"White King, Red Queen\u0411\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c, \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\") and \"Luna Park\u041b\u0443\u043d\u0430-\u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\"). Schwartz also composed music for ballets and theatrical performances and, to a lesser extent, for television. His one symphony, \"Gelbe Sterne \u2013 Purimspiel im Ghetto\", was first performed in Saint Petersburg in 2000: it was inspired by the story of the Kovno Ghetto in Lithuania. Schwartz died in Siversky, near Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation, on 27 December 2009, aged 86.\"",

He directed and wrote over films between 1931 and 1951 even composing the musical scores for several. He was a pioneer of Variety Theatre, and one of the few tango lyrical writers that has reached timeless classical success. When he was a teenager, he began his journalist job in the Magacine Fray Mochoy, and in the newspapers Cr\u00edtica y \u00daltima Hora. His first play, \"Teatro breve\" is from 1919 with the collaboration of Ivo Pelay. He wrote 180 more. In 1922 the most famous, \"El bailar\u00edn del cabaret\", was staged with the C\u00e9sar Ratti's company, where Corsini triunf\u00f3 (had a success) with \"Patotero sentimental\". In 1923 he travelled to Europe with Luis Bay\u00f3n Herrera. In Paris, where he acted on several plays, he met Carlos Gardel and the idea of filmmaking was born. He wrote the plot and songs for \"Luces de Buenos Aires\", directed by the Chilean Adelqui Millar. It starred Gloria Guzm\u00e1n, Sof\u00eda Boz\u00e1n, Pedro Quartucci and the Julio De Caro musical group. He returned to Buenos Aires, where he introduced the new ideas taken from music hall and varieties shows. He started to work at the Lumit\u00f3n cinema company, with Enrique Tel\u00e9maco Susini . With that film company, released in February 1935, \"Noches de Buenos Aires\", written and directed by Romero, his cinema career began. The film starred Tita Merello, Irma C\u00f3rdoba, Enrique Serrano and Fernando Ochoa. He filmed very quickly, he only wanted to finish and achieve a good result. His films were rejected by critics and intellectuals as a result, but ordinary people liked his style because they knew him from radio of variety shows. He directed films such as Adi\u00f3s pampa m\u00eda in 1946.\"",

Later, he attended the technical schools in Bad Frankenhausen and Neustrelitz to study mechanical engineering and aircraft engines, and became a mechanical engineer. In 1937, he was appointed department manager at the Junkers Aircraft Works in Dessau and developed combustion engines. In 1940, he married his wife Lieselotte, and had five children with her. He was a living legend of technology; he played a decisive role in the further development of diesel engine technology. After the war, Elsbett set up an independent factory in Salzgitter for the production of a small two- stroke diesel engine. In 1973 Elsbett gained international recognition for the first ever serial- produced direct- injection diesel engine for cars. In 1977 Elsbett produced an engine fuelled by vegetable oil called the\" Elsbett- motor\". In 1980 Elsbett made the first conversion of standard diesel cars with prechamber engines to vegetable oil. In 1993 the\" Elsbett Mercedes\" won the first Eco Tour of Europe with the lowest consumption of fuel. In 1997 Elsbett won the European Solar Prize. In 2002 Elsbett converted the standard common-rail car engines and unit-injector truck engines to vegetable oil fuel. There is now an Elsbett Museum in the city of Salz, Bavaria, Lower Franconia.\"",

Wynorski has been making B-movies and exploitation movies since the early 1980s, and has directed over 150 feature films. His earliest films were released to movie theaters, but his later works have predominantly been released to cable or the straight-to-video market. He often works under pseudonyms such as \"Jay Andrews,Arch Stanton,H.R. Blueberry,Tom Popatopolis,\" and \"Noble Henry.\" His movies often spoof horror films: \"Cleavagefield\", for example, parodies \"CloverfieldThe Bare Wench Project\" parodies \"The Blair Witch Project\", and \"Para-Knockers Activity\" parodies \"Paranormal Activity\". A character in the film \"The Final Destination\" is named after him. In 2009, the documentary \"Popatopolis\", directed by Clay Westervelt and named for one of Wynorski's pseudonyms, chronicled Wynorski during the making of his soft-core horror film, \"The Witches of Breastwick\". The film serves as a partial biography, with clips from many of his previous films and includes interviews with Wynorski, his contemporaries, cast, and crew. In 2016, he directed \"Nessie & Me\", marking the first time that he directed a children's film. The character Jack O\u2019Grady directly references Wynorski's earlier films \"Dinocroc vs. Supergator\" and \"Piranhaconda\" when he encounters Nessie at the start of the film, hinting that \"Nessie & Me\" is canon to those film series, as well as \"Monster Cruise\", with many characters from it appearing in \"Nessie & Me\" as well.\"",

In North America, it was also issued as the B-side of the album's lead single,\" Blow Away\", while in Britain and some other markets it was the B-side of the follow- up,\" Love Comes to Everyone\". The lyrics recall Harrison's experiences under the hallucinatory effects of magic mushrooms while holidaying on the Hawaiian island of Maui. The song title refers to Hana, a remote town on the island, and is a play on that of the 1920s ragtime tune\" Hard Hearted Hannah\". Harrison began writing the song in Los Angeles in response to Ted Templeman, a staff producer at Warner Bros. Records, suggesting he compose something in a similar style to his 1971 track\" Deep Blue\". He wrote the lyrics in Hawaii in February 1978, during the main writing period for\" George Harrison\", his first album in over two years. Recorded at Harrison's FPSHOT studio in Oxfordshire, the track features dobro, jazz piano, tuba and prominent chorus vocals, as well as voices and sounds captured in his local pub. The musical arrangement recalls the music hall tradition, while the composition's old- time qualities reflect Harrison's earliest influences from the pre-rock and roll era. The other musicians on the recording include Neil Larsen and Stevie Winwood. The song's lyrics employ, variously, psychedelic imagery, rhyming slang, humorous non sequiturs and John Keats- like symbolism. The song was well received by several music critics and revealed a comedic side of Harrison that was relatively unfamiliar to listeners. Author Simon Leng recognises\" Soft- Hearted Hana\" as the start of the\" Pythonization of Harrison's music\", referring to the Monty Python comedy troupe and Harrison's role as a film producer of British comedies such as\" Monty Python's Life of Brian\".\"",

He was the fourth (but second surviving) and youngest son of Johann Frederick II, Duke of Saxony and Countess Palatine Elisabeth of Simmern-Sponheim. His grandfather, Johann Frederick I, had still held the title of Elector of Saxony, but after the Battle of M\u00fchlberg he lost the title to his cousin Maurice, from the Albertine line. His father tried since then to regain the Electorate again for the Ernestine line. For this purpose he accepted an outlawed knight, Wilhelm von Grumbach, with himself, which led finally to the fact that also over his father the anger of the Emperor. Only one year after his birth was besieged the castle of his father in Gotha by troops of the Elector Augustus of Saxony and finally conquered. His father came into imperial prison from the rest of his life. His mother, Johann Ernst and his older brothers had to flee from Gotha. They found first admission with his uncle, the duke Johann Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar, who took over also the guardianship for the princes -at the same time, he was granted by the Emperor with the lands of his brother Johann Frederick II-. After a short time in Weimar, Johann Ernst, as well as his mother and his brothers, lived in Eisenach and Eisenberg. Later, his uncle Johann Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar lost the Imperial favour. In the Diet of Speyer (1570), the Emperor decided to restore to the three sons of Johann Frederick II his hereditary rights. In 1572 his older brother Frederick Heinrich died from typhus fever. The same year, by the Division of Erfurt, the decision of the Diet of Speyer was made: The lands of his father were extracted again from the duchy of Saxe-Weimar, and created from them the new \"Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach\". Johann Ernst and his older surviving brother, Johann Casimir, were made rulers of the new country. During there minority, the lands were under the guardianship of the three Elector Princes: Frederick III of the Palatinate (also his maternal grandfather), Johann George of Brandenburg and Augustus of Saxony; also, they took the regency over Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. The duchess Elizabeth moved to Austria, where she should live themselves in the future in the proximity of her husband, still imperial prissioner. The two young princes, Johann Casimir and Johann Ernst, moved to Coburg, the future residence of his new principality. With only six years, Johann Ernst was separated from his parents forever and entrusted to the education of strange persons. Since 1578 he visited the University of Leipzig then together with his brother. In 1586, after the wedding of his brother with Anna of Saxony, the daughter of the Elector Augustus, the guardianship finalized, and Johann Casimir began, together with his brother, the independent ruling of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. Johann Casimir and Johann Ernst governed together the principality for the next ten years; however, Johann Casimir carried the main responsibility for the government as an older brother. Also, in order to had a separated residence from his brother too, Johann Ernst establishes himself in the small town of Marksuhl on 1587. Since 1590 Johann Ernst withdrew himself from the government of the duchy, with his brother completely agreed it, that this should govern the duchy for five years alone, when this time had elapsed and finally agreed (in 1596) with its brother to a new divisionary treaty. The duchy of Saxe-Eisenach was taken by Johann Ernst as independent principality separated from Saxe-Coburg, who remained with Johann Casimir. Thus, Saxe-Eisenach, for the first time in his history, had his own independent political unit became within the Holy Roman Empire. During his first year of reign, Johann Ernst still live in Marsuhl because Eisenach, the new capital of his country, was inhabited and, only with the establishment of his official residence the citizens began to moved there. In 1598 Johann Ernst created for his duchy his own \"Landesregierung\" (Federal State Government) and a\" Konsistorium\". In 1633 his brother, the duke Johann Casimir of Saxe-Coburg, died childless. For this, Johann Ernst inherited Saxe-Coburg, and until his own death he governed both countries in a personal union, but maintains, however, his residence in Eisenach. In Wiener Neustadt on 23 November 1591 Johann Ernst married firstly with Elisabeth of Mansfeld-Hinterort. She died four days after giving birth to their only son: In Rotenburg on 14 May 1598 Johann Ernst married secondly with Christine of Hesse-Kassel. The marriage was happy, but remained childless. With the death of Johann Ernst ended the older line of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. His principality was divided (under the rules of the Ernestine line) between Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Altenburg.\"",

He held the positions of sessho or kanpaku for a twenty- year period, sessho from 1075 to 1086 during the reign of Emperor Shirakawa and from 1094 to 1099 during the reign of Emperor Horikawa, and kampaku from 1086 to 1094 during the reign of Emperor Horikawa. He was the son of Fujiwara no Yorimichi and Fujiwara no Gishi( \u85e4\u539f \u7947\u5b50, her real name is unknown today), a daughter of Fujiwara no Tanenari( \u85e4\u539f \u7a2e \u6210), hence the grandson of Fujiwara no Michinaga. A contemporary document suggested he was the third born son, but this is uncertain. He was appointed to the positions of sadaijin, sessho and kampaku. He made his adopted daughter Kenshi( \u8ce2\u5b50) a consort of Emperor Shirakawa. Kenshi died when she was very young, but she left a son who would later ascend to the throne as Emperor Horikawa. Emperor Shirakawa seized political power and Morozane was unable to enjoy the monopolic power that his father and grandfather had enjoyed. Even after Emperor Horikawa reached adulthood, the cloistered Emperor Shirakawa seized power. Morozane married Fujiwara no Reishi, who was a daughter of Minamoto no Morofusa, a grandson of Emperor Murakami, and later adopted by Fujiwara no Nobuie. Morozane had many sons and daughters, including Fujiwara no Moromichi and Fujiwara no Ietada. From Morozane, two kuge families derive, the Kazanin family and the Oimikado( Oinomikado) family. Morozane is also known the author of the waka collection\" Ky\u014dgoku Kanpakush \u016b\"( Anthology of Ky\u014dgoku Kanpaku) and the diary\" Ky\u014dgoku Kanpaku- ki\"( Diary of Ky\u014dgoku Kanpaku).\"",

He was the son of Sultan Mahmud II and succeeded his brother Abdulmejid I in 1861. Born at Ey\u00fcp Palace, Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), on 8 February 1830, Abd\u00fclaziz received an Ottoman education but was nevertheless an ardent admirer of the material progress that was made in the West. He was the first Ottoman Sultan who travelled to Western Europe, visiting a number of important European capitals including Paris, London and Vienna in the summer of 1867. Apart from his passion for the Ottoman Navy, which had the world's third largest fleet in 1875 (after the British and French navies), the Sultan took an interest in documenting the Ottoman Empire. He was also interested in literature and was a talented classical music composer. Some of his compositions, together with those of the other members of the Ottoman dynasty, have been collected in the album \"European Music at the Ottoman Court\" by the London Academy of Ottoman Court Music. He was deposed on grounds of mismanaging the Ottoman economy on 30 May 1876, and was found dead six days later under unnatural and mysterious circumstances.\"",

After the war Mimica wrote literary and film reviews, and his career in filmmaking began in 1950 when he became the director of the Jadran Film production studio. He had his directorial and screenwriting debut in the 1952 Yugoslav film \" In the Storm\" (Croatian: \"U oluji\") which starred Veljko Bulaji\u0107, Mia Oremovi\u0107 and Antun Nalis. In the 1950s Mimica worked as a director and writer on a number of critically acclaimed animated films and became a prominent member of the Zagreb School of Animated Films (his 1958 animated short film \"The LonerSamac\") was awarded the Venice Grand Prix), along with authors such as Vlado Kristl and Academy Award-winning Du\u0161an Vukoti\u0107. In the 1960s Mimica moved away from animation (his last animated film was 1971 film \"The FiremenVatrogasci\")) and turned to directing feature films, starting with the 1961 Yugoslav-Italian film \"Suleiman the Conqueror\" (Italian: \"Solimano il conquistatore\") starring Edmund Purdom and Giorgia Moll. His 1965 film \"Prometheus of the IslandPrometej s otoka Vi\u0161evice\") won the Big Golden Arena for Best Film at the 1965 Pula Film Festival and earned Mimica a runner-up Silver Arena award for Best Director. It was also entered into the 4th Moscow International Film Festival winning a Special Diploma. The following year his 1966 film \"Monday or TuesdayPonedjeljak ili utorak\") also won the Big Golden Arena for Best Film and Mimica won the Golden Arena for Best Director. Mimica made several other films through the 1970s, most notably the period films \"Anno Domini 1573 (Peasant revolt of 1573)Selja\u010dka buna 1573.\" in Croatian - depicting the 16th century Croatian-Slovenian peasant revolt, and \"The FalconBanovi\u0107 Strahinja\"), set in 14th century Serbia, before retiring from filmmaking in 1981.

He was the most prominent sculptor of Croatian modern sculpture and a leading personality of artistic life in Zagreb. He studied at the Pavle Bilini\u0107's Stone Workshop in Split and at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he was formed under the influence of the Secession. He traveled throughout Europe and studied the works of ancient and Renaissance masters, especially Michelangelo, and French sculptors A. Rodin, A. Bourdelle and A. Maillola. He was the initiator of the national-romantic group Meduli\u0107 (he advocated the creation of art of national features inspired by the heroic folk songs). During the First World War, he lived in emigration. After the war, he returned to Croatia and began a long and fruitful period of sculpture and pedagogical work. In 1942 he emigrated to Italy, in 1943 to Switzerland and in 1947 to the United States. He was a professor of sculpture at the Syracuse University and from 1955 at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. Most of his early works of symbolic themes were formed in the spirit of the Secession, some of which, like the Well of Life, show impressionist restless surfaces created under the influence of Rodin's naturalism, and the second, reviving national myth, become stylized monumental plastics (Kosovo cycle, 1908-1910). Before the First World War, he left pathetic epic stylization, expressing increasingly emotional states, as evidenced by the wooden reliefs of biblical themes made in a combination of Archaic, Gothic, Secessionist and Expressionist styles. During the 1920s and 1930s, the classical component prevailed in his works. In this period, he created a number of public monuments of strong plastic expression, pronounced and legible shapes (Grgur Ninski and Marko Maruli\u0107 in Split, Andrija Meduli\u0107, Andrija Ka\u010di\u0107-Mio\u0161i\u0107 and Josip Juraj Strossmayer in Zagreb, \"The Bowman\" and \"The Spearman\" in Chicago). Portraits take a special place in his opus. Me\u0161trovi\u0107 achieved works of strong plastic value in the construction-sculptural monuments and projects, mostly with central layout (the Mausoleum of the Ra\u010di\u0107 family in Cavtat, the Mausoleum of the Me\u0161trovi\u0107 family in Otavice, the Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Pavilion in Zagreb, Monument to the Unknown Hero in Belgrade). He also designed a memorial church of King Zvonimir in Biskupija near Knin inspired by old Croatian churches, a representative family palace, today the Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Gallery, and reconstructed renaissance fortified mansion Crikvine-Ka\u0161tilac in Split.\"",

Christopher Newton received the death penalty for the 2001 aggravated murder of his cellmate, Jason Brewer. At the time of the murder, Newton was imprisoned for attempted aggravated burglary of his father's home, an offense he committed a few weeks after his release from prison for a prior attempted aggravated burglary. Newton killed Brewer in their cell by stomping on his neck and head and strangling him with a strip of cloth. According to the opinion of the Ohio Supreme Court affirming the death penalty, Newton laughed while responding officials tried to resuscitate Brewer, having smeared Brewer's blood on his face and drunk some of it( stating,\" if he is not dead, I hope he is going to be a vegetable\"). Newton admitted that another inmate had hired him to assault Brewer, and that he was ready to die in prison and knew that murdering another inmate would warrant the death penalty. According to the Ohio Supreme Court, numerous psychiatrists and psychologists had examined Newton over the years, resulting in various diagnoses. At the capital trial, a defense psychologist testified that Newton had several mental health disorders, including\" mood disorder\" and symptoms of PTSD. In response, a government psychiatrist reviewed the mental health history and rebutted the defense expert. The court denied defense funds for neuropsychiatric tests to explore other types of mental disability. The trial was before a three- court panel of judges who, after hearing the evidence, imposed the death penalty. A controversy arose regarding the delay in Newton's execution, as at the time, which made administration of the injections difficult. It took over two hours and 10 attempts before the execution was completed. The problems with Newton's execution occurred one year after the 90 minute execution of fellow Ohio inmate, Joseph Lewis Clark.\"",

He started with amateur short films after acquiring a projector and a 8mm camera in 1947. From 1949 he studied at the Academy for Theatre, Radio, Film and Television in Ljubljana and made a name for himself with several highly acclaimed short films. In 1957, Hladnik moved to Paris to apprentice under French filmmakers such as Claude Chabrol, Philipe de Broca, and Robert Siodmak. Hladnik's early-'60s features, Ples v de\u017eju (Dance in the Rain) (1961) and Pe\u0161\u010deni grad/Sand Castle (1962), influenced the course of Yugoslav cinema, through integrating influences from the nouvelle vague into it. Hladnik has an obsession with eroticism. He made many films dealing openly with sex and his Erotikon (1963), with its openly sensual approach to taboo sexual relationships, not only triggered angry protests in the press, but it also led to it being banned in some Yugoslav republics. Western European critics and public however, supported Hladnik enough for him to find foreign backing for his even more provocative feature film on sexuality, Ma\u0161karada/Masquerade(1971).

She probably married \u00c6thelred before 679 and was murdered by the nobles of Mercia. Osthryth was not the first of her family to become a Mercian queen. Her sister Alhfl\u00e6d had married Peada, King of South Mercia 654-656. After the death of Peada, who was allegedly murdered with Alhfl\u00e6d's connivance, and possibly Osthryth's as well, she retreated to Fladbury in Worcestershire, to judge both from the place-name, which means \"stronghold of Fl\u00e6de\", and from its subsequent history: sometime in the 690s \u00c6thelred granted Fladbury to Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester, to re-establish monastic life there; however, this grant was later contested by \u00c6thelheard, son of Oshere, who maintained that \u00c6thelred had no right to give Fladbury away, as it had been the property of Osthryth. \u00c6thelheard claimed it as her kinsman and heir. \u00c6thelred and Osthryth loved and favoured Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire. Osthryth placed there the bones of her uncle Oswald of Northumbria, who was venerated as a saint. It is clear from this story that Osthryth played a part in promoting the cult of St Oswald. Many years later she persuaded Oswald's widow Cyneburh to take the veil. Osthryth had to contend with major conflicts of loyalty. In 679 her brother Ecgfrith of Northumbria fought a battle against \u00c6thelred, in which Ecgfrith's brother \u00c6lfwine was killed. Bede tells us that he was \"a young man of about eighteen years of age and much beloved in both kingdoms, for King \u00c6thelred had married his sister.\" The murder of Osthryth in 697 by Mercian nobles is unexplained in the sources that mention it. Ann Williams attributes it to the hostility between the Mercians and the Northumbrians, while D. P. Kirby suggests that it may have been revenge for her sister's alleged involvement in Peada's murder. H. P. R. Finberg speculates that she and her kinsman Oshere were suspected of trying to detach the kingdom of the Hwicce from Mercian overlordship. Osthryth was buried at Bardney Abbey. Osthryth was probably the mother of \u00c6thelred's son, Ceolred, king of Mercia from 709 to 716.\"",

Murray had planned to travel to Sydney, to join the Redfern All Blacks Rugby League team's tour of New Zealand when he was detained. Police claimed that they found Murray hanging in his cell at the Wee Waa Police Station around 3:30 pm, and argued that he committed suicide, although this occurred prior to the majority of Aboriginal deaths in custody which were later examined in the 1987 Royal Commission. He was 21 years old at the time. Eddie Murray's parents, Leila Jane( n\u00e9e Button) and Arthur Edward Murray remained unconvinced that their son's death was a suicide, and fought for a more extensive investigation into Murray's death. Murray's death has helped to draw attention to the issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody. Murray's case has drawn the attention of several investigations, including the Muirhead Royal Commission, the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board Report on Street offences, and his case was one of the first to be investigated by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1988. In 1997, Murray's body was exhumed and re-autopsied, revealing a previously undetected smashed sternum, and a forensic pathologist determined that the injury had most likely occurred immediately prior to his death. Despite this, the details of his death remain a mystery, and still no one has been officially implicated in his death. This has been to the dissatisfaction of Murray's family, who have called for a more extensive inquiry.\"",

A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are left unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure. The work was reportedly intended to be semi-autobiographical in nature; according to Wiseau, the title alludes to the potential of a room to be the site of both good and bad events. The stage play from which the film is derived was so- called due to its events taking place in a single room. A number of publications have labeled\" The Room\" as one of the worst films ever made. An assistant professor of film studies was the first to describe\" The Room\" as\" the\" Citizen Kane\" of bad movies\". Originally shown only in a limited number of California theaters,\" The Room\" quickly became a cult film due to its bizarre and unconventional storytelling, technical and narrative flaws, and Wiseau's off- kilter performance. Although Wiseau has retrospectively described the film as a black comedy, audiences have generally viewed it as a poorly made drama, an opinion shared by some of the cast. \" The Disaster Artist\", Sestero's memoir of the making of\" The Room\", was co-written with Tom Bissell and published in 2013.

Raymond, born in Vienna, was the third child (after two daughters) of Vinzenz Vesely, an employee of the Austrian state railway system, and his wife Henriette, n\u00e9e Dluhos. Both parents were of Czech descent. They intended their son to study mining after high school, and pursure a career in the civil service. After the premature death of both his parents, Raymond studied at a commercial academy and trained as a banker. Raymond composed operetta music as well as copious pieces for films and Schlager, which were very successful in the 1920s and 1930s and were commonly heard being sung and whistled in the streets. He became world-famous with his 1925 composition  (\"I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg\"), and his pieces were considered to be very much in the typical style of the 1920s, especially  (\"I Saw Miss Helen Bathing\") or  (\"I Lost An Eyelash\"). Due to a weak heart, he spent his military service with a propaganda company which served the Belgrade military transmitter. After the war, he took a short break from the Salzburg Radio Orchestra to go to Hamburg, where he finished his last two operettas, \"Geliebte ManuelaBeloved Manuela\") and \"Flieder aus WienLilacs from Vienna\"). In 1951, he moved to a new home in \u00dcberlingen, where he spent three years with his young wife Eva-Maria before dying of a heart failure shortly before the birth of their son, Thomas. His marble grave is located in \u00dcberlingen, on the shore of Lake Constance, and is decorated with a lyre. To commemorate the eightieth year of his birth, a street was named after him in the Donaustadt district.\"",

Her 47-year rule over Sark, in the Channel Islands, spanned the reigns of four Monarchs: George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Elizabeth II. Hathaway was a financially troubled widow with six children when she succeeded her eccentric father, William Frederick Collings, as feudal lady of Sark. She immediately set about reinforcing her feudal rights and promoting tourism on the island, which she affectionately called \"the last bastion of feudalism\". When she remarried in 1929, her second husband, Robert Hathaway, legally became her senior co-ruler, but she kept control of the government. Hathaway's tenure saw the German occupation of the Channel Islands in the Second World War, during which she refused to evacuate and convinced the islanders to stay as well. Her eldest son and heir apparent, Francis William Beaumont, was killed in 1941, while her husband was deported to an internment camp in 1943. Hathaway remains best known for her indomitable conduct during the occupation. After the war, she continued her publicity campaign, strengthening the island's tourism industry. Having been widowed again in 1954, she went on to rule alone, and was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1965. She was described by a British government official as a \"lady of unusual personality\", and is often referred to as a benevolent dictator. Dame Sibyl died at the age of 90, and was succeeded by her grandson, Michael Beaumont.\"",

Kim was born in Seoul during the colonial period, raised in Pyongyang, where he became interested in theater and cinema. In Korea after the end of World War II, he studied dentistry while becoming involved in the theater. During the Korean War, he made propaganda films for the United States Information Service. In 1955, he used discarded movie equipments to produce his first two films. With the success of these two films Kim formed his own production company and produced popular melodramas for the rest of the decade. Kim Ki-young's first expression of his mature style was in his\" The Housemaid\"( 1960), which featured a powerful\" femme fatale\" character. It is widely considered to be one of the best Korean films of all time. After a\" Golden Age\" during the 1960s, the 1970s were a low- point in the history of Korean cinema because of governmental censorship and a decrease in audience attendance. Nevertheless, working independently, Kim produced some of his most eccentric cinematic creations in this era. Films such as\" Insect Woman\"( 1972) and\" Iodo\"( 1977) were successful at the time and highly influential on the younger generations of South Korean filmmakers both at their time of release, and with their rediscovery years later. By the 1980s, Kim's popularity had gone into decline, and his output decreased in the second half of the decade. Neglected by the mainstream during much of the 1990s, Kim became a cult figure in South Korean film Internet forums in the early 1990s. Widespread international interest in his work was stimulated by a career retrospective at the 1997 Pusan International Film Festival. He was preparing a comeback film when he and his wife were killed in a house fire in 1998. The Berlin International Film Festival gave Kim a posthumous retrospective in 1998, and the French Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que screened 18 of Kim's films, some newly rediscovered and restored, in 2006. Through the efforts of the Korean Film Council( KOFIC), previously lost films by Kim Ki- young continue to be rediscovered and restored. Many current prominent South Korean filmmakers, including directors Im Sang- soo, Kim Ki-duk, Bong Joon- ho and Park Chan- wook, claim Kim Ki- young as an influence on their careers.\"",

When Marianus V, the youngest son of Beatrice' elder sister Eleanor, died in 1407, Arborea experienced a succession crisis. The late Beatrice had a claim to the judgeship which was picked up by her grandson, son of William I. The real judge from 1407 was Leonardo Cubello, great nephew of Hugh II of Arborea. On 6 October 1408, Martin I of Sicily disembarked at Cagliari with a strong army. On 8 December, William also reached Cagliari. He was crowned\" King of Arborea, Count of Goceano, and Viscount of Bas\" at Oristano on 13 January 1409. The two forces, of Martin and of William, met at the Battle of Sanluri. The Arborean troops of William, including many Genoese crossbowmen, broke into two battles. The left battle was destroyed in a location called\" occidroxiu\"( the slaughterhouse). The right battle was broken into two part, the first was being chased to Sanluri and eventually was routed there, and the other one was forced by William to take refuge in the castle of Monreale, in the nearby village of Sardara, and continued the resistant. On 4 July, the Villa di Chiesa surrendered to Giovanni di Sena, which dealt a crippling blow to Arborea even though the Sicilian king had died on 25 July in Cagliari. William returned to France to seek aid, leaving Leonardo Cubello in charge in his absence. Leonardo successfully defended Oristano. William returned to Sardinia in Spring 1410. He reorganised his territories with his capital at Sassari. With the help of Nicol\u00f2 Doria, he recaptured Longosardo on 9 August. He tried to take Oristano and Alghero, which were defended by Peter Torrelles, who died of malaria in 1411. On 5 and 6 May 1412, he entered Alghero, but was driven off by the citizenry. With the chances of victory turned out to be grim, William reluctantly surrendered and sold Arborea to Alfonso V on 17 August 1420 for 100,000 gold florins.

Comita succeeded his father Constantine I of Arborea. The date of this succession is assumed to be 1131, when he first appears in a communication with the Republic of Genoa. In 1130, Constantine, Gonario II of Torres, and Comita I of Gallura had sworn fealty to the archbishop of Pisa. In 1133, Pope Innocent II raised Genoa to archiepiscopal status and divided the island of Sardinia between the two sees, giving the north to Genoa and the south to Pisa. In the subsequent wars of that decade, Comita was the sole ally of the Genoese. From 1133 to 1145, there is a gap in the testimony referring to Comita and it is possible that his brother Torbeno successfully usurped his throne during a war with the Giudicato of Logudoro. In 1145, Comita was back in power and was excommunicated by Baldwin, Archbishop of Pisa. The Pisan prelate, travelling the island as a papal legate, had excommunicated the judge for oppressing the people and warring against Pisa. Bernard of Clairvaux even weighed into island politics and sent a letter to Pope Eugene III to justify Baldwin's actions. Nominally Arborea was transferred to Logudoro. Comita died soon after.\"",

He was a pioneer of Variety Theatre, and one of the few tango lyrical writers that has reached timeless classical success. When he was a teenager, he began his journalist job in the Magacine Fray Mochoy, and in the newspapers Cr\u00edtica y \u00daltima Hora. His first play, \"Teatro breve\" is from 1919 with the collaboration of Ivo Pelay. He wrote 180 more. In 1922 the most famous, \"El bailar\u00edn del cabaret\", was staged with the C\u00e9sar Ratti's company, where Corsini triunf\u00f3 (had a success) with \"Patotero sentimental\". In 1923 he travelled to Europe with Luis Bay\u00f3n Herrera. In Paris, where he acted on several plays, he met Carlos Gardel and the idea of filmmaking was born. He wrote the plot and songs for \"Luces de Buenos Aires\", directed by the Chilean Adelqui Millar. It starred Gloria Guzm\u00e1n, Sof\u00eda Boz\u00e1n, Pedro Quartucci and the Julio De Caro musical group. He returned to Buenos Aires, where he introduced the new ideas taken from music hall and varieties shows. He started to work at the Lumit\u00f3n cinema company, with Enrique Tel\u00e9maco Susini . With that film company, released in February 1935, \"Noches de Buenos Aires\", written and directed by Romero, his cinema career began. The film starred Tita Merello, Irma C\u00f3rdoba, Enrique Serrano and Fernando Ochoa. He filmed very quickly, he only wanted to finish and achieve a good result. His films were rejected by critics and intellectuals as a result, but ordinary people liked his style because they knew him from radio of variety shows.

He introduced the currency of rupee. An ethnic Pashtun, Sher Shah took control of the Mughal Empire in 1538. After his accidental death in 1545, his son Islam Shah became his successor. He first served as a private before rising to become a commander in the Mughal army under Babur and then the governor of Bihar. In 1537, when Babur's son Humayun was elsewhere on an expedition, Sher Shah overran the state of Bengal and established the Suri dynasty. A brilliant strategist, Sher Shah proved himself as a gifted administrator as well as a capable general. His reorganization of the empire laid the foundations for the later Mughal emperors, notably Akbar, son of Humayun. During his seven-year rule from 1538 to 1545, he set up a new economic and military administration, issued the first \"Rupiya\" from \"Taka\" and organized the postal system of the Indian Subcontinent. Some of his strategies and contributions were later ideolized by the Mughal emperors, most notably Akbar. Suri further developed Humayun's \"Dina-panah\" city and named it Shergarh and revived the historical city of Pataliputra, which had been in decline since the 7th century CE, as Patna. He extended the Grand Trunk Road from Chittagong in the frontiers of the province of Bengal in northeast India to Kabul in Afghanistan in the far northwest of the country.

In 1622, aged 20, he married his 14- year- old aunt Ana Mar\u00eda de Guzm\u00e1n( 1607 \u2013 1637), having four children by her, of which only the youngest, Gaspar Juan, survived to inherit the title. In 1639, the 9th Duke was married for a second time to Seville noblewoman Juana Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, but only after signing documents giving the considerable amount of 20,000 Ducados to Margarita Mara\u00f1on, on condition she become a nun near his palace in Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, later in a Dominican convent. It is said she was the mother of his illegitimate daughter, Luisa. In 1640, his sister Luisa of Guzman became the new Queen of Portugal, as the wife of the former Duke of Braganza, now John IV of Portugal. In 1641 the 9th Duke led the Andalusian rebellion against Spanish rule. Though both Portugal and Catalonia had strong cultural identities, an historical record of independence, and popular support, Andalusia did not, and the rebellion failed. The duke had the support of his brother- in- law, John IV of Portugal, but the promised naval aid from France and the Netherlands did not arrive. The king of Spain forgave his treason, but the previous prestige of his house was only regained by his successor.\"",

It was released worldwide in six different formats on December 25, 2013 by Avex Trax, Avex Taiwan, and Avex Entertainment Inc. It was also Hamasaki's first physical release in three years since her EP\u2013single \"L\" (2010), and her first double A-side single, alongside the track \"Feel the Love\", since \"Moon\" and \"Blossom\" that same year. The track was written by Hamasaki, whilst production was handled by Japanese musician and long-time collaborator Max Matsuura with the assistance of M-Flo; this marks Hamasaki's first single to be produced with another producer outside of Matsuura. Musically, \"Merry-Go-Round\" is an electronic dance song that includes guitars and synthesizers in its instrumentation. Upon its release, \"Merry-Go-Round\" received favorable reviews from music critics. The majority of them praised the composition, production, and Hamasaki's vocal performance, whilst others also highlighted the track as one of the best entries on \"Colours\". Charting together with \"Feel the Love\", it underperformed in Japan, reaching number five on the Oricon Singles Chart, and was her first single to miss the top spot since her single \"Daybreak\" twelve years earlier. Two accompanying music videos were shot by Luis Hernandez and Satoru Yokoyama, which featured Hamasaki in Los Angeles, California at the top of a skyscraper, and her with another man; the Yokoyama version also included an appearance with Verbal. To promote the single, Hamasaki performed the track on her 2013\u20132014 Countdown live tour.\"",

Atang de la Rama was born in Pandacan, Manila on January 11, 1902. By the age of 7, she was already starring in Spanish \"zarzuelas\" such as \"MascotaSue\u00f1o de un Vals\", and \"Marina\". At the age of 15, she starred in the sarsuela \"Dalagang Bukid\", where she became known for singing the song, \"Nabasag na Banga\". During the American occupation of the Philippines, Atang de la Rama fought for the dominance of the \"kundiman\", an important Philippine folk song, and the \"sarsuela\", which is a musical play that focused on contemporary Filipino issues such as usury, cockfighting, and colonial mentality. Generations of Filipino artists and audiences consider Atang de la Rama's vocal and acting talents as responsible for much of the success of original Filipino sarsuelas like \"Dalagang Bukid\", and dramas like \"Veronidia\". She has also been a theatrical producer, writer and talent manager. She was the producer and the writer of plays such as \"Anak ni Eva\" and \"Bulaklak ng Kabundukan\". For her achievements and contributions to the art form, she was hailed Queen of the Kundiman and of the Sarsuela in 1979, at the age of 74. Atang believed that art should be for everyone; not only did she perform in major Manila theaters such as the \"Teatro Libertad\" and the \"Teatro Zorilla\", but also in cockpits and open plazas in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. She also made an effort to bring the kundiman and sarsuela to the indigenous peoples of the Philippine such as the Igorots, the Aetas, and the Mangyans. She was also at the forefront of introducing Filipino culture to foreign audiences. At the height of her career, she sang kundimans and other Filipino songs in concerts in such cities as Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo. On May 8, 1987, \"for her sincere devotion to original Filipino theater and music, her outstanding artistry as singer, and as sarsuela actress-playwright-producer, her tireless efforts to bring her art to all sectors of Filipino society and to the world,\" President Corazon C. Aquino proclaimed Atang de la Rama a National Artist of the Philippines for Theater and Music. Atang de la Rama died on July 11, 1991. She was married to National Artist for Literature, Amado V. Hernandez.\"",

The film tells the story of a schizophrenic young woman (Andersson) vacationing with her family on a remote island, during which time her author father attempts to use her illness in his work, her brother experiences sexual frustration, and she experiences delusions about meeting God, who appears to her in the form of a monstrous spider. Bergman structured the film as a three-act play, drawing on his personal experiences and relationships. The film was his first of several shot on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6, at the recommendation of cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The score incorporates the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Themes explored include the equation of God with love, exploitation in art, psychosis, and sexuality. \"Through a Glass Darkly\" was released to positive reviews, specifically for Andersson's performance, and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

The film centers on a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny( Wiseau), his deceptive fianc\u00e9e Lisa( Danielle) and his conflicted best friend Mark( Sestero). A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are left unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure. The work was reportedly intended to be semi-autobiographical in nature; according to Wiseau, the title alludes to the potential of a room to be the site of both good and bad events. The stage play from which the film is derived was so- called due to its events taking place in a single room. A number of publications have labeled\" The Room\" as one of the worst films ever made. An assistant professor of film studies was the first to describe\" The Room\" as\" the\" Citizen Kane\" of bad movies\". Originally shown only in a limited number of California theaters,\" The Room\" quickly became a cult film due to its bizarre and unconventional storytelling, technical and narrative flaws, and Wiseau's off- kilter performance. Although Wiseau has retrospectively described the film as a black comedy, audiences have generally viewed it as a poorly made drama, an opinion shared by some of the cast. \" The Disaster Artist\", Sestero's memoir of the making of\" The Room\", was co-written with Tom Bissell and published in 2013. A film of the same name based on the book, directed by and starring James Franco, was released on December 1, 2017; the book and film received widespread acclaim and numerous award nominations. \" The Room\" also inspired an unofficial video game adaptation,\" The Room Tribute\", released on Newgrounds in 2010.\"",

Based on Harry Grey's novel \"The Hoods\", it chronicles the lives of best friends David \"Noodles\" Aaronson and Maximilian \"Max\" Bercovicz as they lead a group of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence as Jewish gangsters in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, together with the rise of mobsters in American society. It was the final film directed by Leone before his death five years later, and the first feature film he had directed in 13 years. It is also the third film of Leone's \"Once Upon a Time Trilogy\", which includes \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968) and \"Duck, You Sucker!\" (1971). The cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the film score by Ennio Morricone. Leone originally envisaged two three-hour films, then a single 269-minute (4 hours and 29 minutes) version, but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes). The American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes, and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone's involvement. The shortened version was a critical and commercial flop in the United States, and critics who had seen both versions harshly condemned the changes that were made. The original \"European cut\" has remained a critical favorite and frequently appears in lists of the greatest gangster films of all time.\"",

After his 1972 success with \"Deep Throat\", Damiano shot the film in a converted apple-packing plant in Milanville, Pennsylvania. Along with \"Deep Throat\" and \"Behind the Green Door\", the film is associated with a time in American culture known as \"porno chic\", in which adult erotic films were just beginning to be widely released, publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope) and taken seriously by film critics (like Roger Ebert). The film's plot was inspired by the 1944 play \"No Exit\" by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. \" The Devil in Miss Jones\" went on to spawn numerous remakes and sequels. As with many films of the Golden Age of Porn, the copyright status of \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" is unresolved. VCX claims a copyright; rival distributor Arrow Productions distributed unauthorized copies of the film for a time before 2009, when (as part of a mutual truce between the companies) Arrow agreed to accept VCX's copyright claim in exchange for not challenging Arrow's copyright claim on \"Deep Throat\".\"",

She was a sister of King Constantine I of Greece and a first cousin of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. Born as a princess of Greece and Denmark, she was educated in Athens by private tutors. Her father instilled in her a great love for Greece and throughout her life, she remained a fervent patriot. She married Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia, her first cousin once removed, who courted her for five years. The wedding took place in 1900 in Corfu. The couple settled in St. Petersburg and they had two daughters: Princesses Nina (1901 -1974) and Xenia of Russia (1903 -1965). Grand Duke George Mikhailovich had a house built for her in Crimea and he was a devoted father and husband, but the marriage was unhappy. Princess Maria, known upon her marriage as Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna of Russia, neither get to love her husband nor her adopted country. Longing for her native Greece, she never adapted to live in Russia. Over the years, she became estranged from her husband taking any opportunity to spend time abroad. At the outbreak of World War I, she was vacationing in England with her daughters and chose not to return to Russia. During the conflict, she was a patron of three military hospitals in Harrogate, which she financed generously. Her husband was trapped in Russia after the revolution and he was shot by the Bolsheviks with several other Romanov relatives in January 1919. In her widowhood, deprived of her Russian income, Princess Maria faced serious financial difficulties. She returned to live in Greece with her daughters in 1920. There, she began a relationship with Admiral Perikles Ioannidis, who had been the commander of the ship that she took at her return to Athens. They were married in 1922. The proclamation of the Second Hellenic Republic in 1924, sent her into exile. The princess returned to live in Britain for a couple of years and she settled in Rome in 1926 with her second husband. She lived in Italy for over a decade until the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War in 1940 forced her to return to her native Greece. She was in poor health and was cared for by her nephew King Paul of Greece and his wife Frederica. She died, as the Greek royal family was about to leave for exile. She left a book of memoirs, published posthumously by her grandchildren with the title \"A Romanov Diary\".\"",

The film was based on the characters Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne, who made their first appearance in the\" Sandesh\" magazine in 1915, with illustrations by Ray's grandfather Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. In 1961, after the revival of\" Sandesh\", Ray began contemplating the idea of making a film based on that story, and he was partly compelled by his son Sandip to make a film which was less' grim and adult'. This was matched by Ray's own desire to make a movie that, unlike his previous movies, would cater to children. Plus this would also give him an opportunity to lace the story with music and dancing, a point his movies' producers and distributors were always insisting upon. Ray managed to convince producers to finance the movie, even though it was clear from the beginning that the film would cost a lot of money. The movie released to great critical and commercial reception, which held the record for longest continuous run of a Bengali- language movie in Bengal, as it ran for 51 straight weeks. It won the Best Feature Film and Best Direction awards at the 16th National Film Awards, and went on to win many other international awards as well. Critical reception was highly positive. Raja Sen called it to be the most innovative movie to have ever come out of India. Phil Hall said that the movie\" comes as a delightful surprise \u2013 Ray, it appears, not only possessed a great sense of humor but also enjoyed a stunning talent for musical cinema.\"\"",

She probably married \u00c6thelred before 679 and was murdered by the nobles of Mercia. Osthryth was not the first of her family to become a Mercian queen. Her sister Alhfl\u00e6d had married Peada, King of South Mercia 654-656. After the death of Peada, who was allegedly murdered with Alhfl\u00e6d's connivance, and possibly Osthryth's as well, she retreated to Fladbury in Worcestershire, to judge both from the place-name, which means \"stronghold of Fl\u00e6de\", and from its subsequent history: sometime in the 690s \u00c6thelred granted Fladbury to Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester, to re-establish monastic life there; however, this grant was later contested by \u00c6thelheard, son of Oshere, who maintained that \u00c6thelred had no right to give Fladbury away, as it had been the property of Osthryth. \u00c6thelheard claimed it as her kinsman and heir. \u00c6thelred and Osthryth loved and favoured Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire. Osthryth placed there the bones of her uncle Oswald of Northumbria, who was venerated as a saint. It is clear from this story that Osthryth played a part in promoting the cult of St Oswald. Many years later she persuaded Oswald's widow Cyneburh to take the veil. Osthryth had to contend with major conflicts of loyalty. In 679 her brother Ecgfrith of Northumbria fought a battle against \u00c6thelred, in which Ecgfrith's brother \u00c6lfwine was killed. Bede tells us that he was \"a young man of about eighteen years of age and much beloved in both kingdoms, for King \u00c6thelred had married his sister.\" The murder of Osthryth in 697 by Mercian nobles is unexplained in the sources that mention it. Ann Williams attributes it to the hostility between the Mercians and the Northumbrians, while D. P. Kirby suggests that it may have been revenge for her sister's alleged involvement in Peada's murder. H. P. R. Finberg speculates that she and her kinsman Oshere were suspected of trying to detach the kingdom of the Hwicce from Mercian overlordship. Osthryth was buried at Bardney Abbey. Osthryth was probably the mother of \u00c6thelred's son, Ceolred, king of Mercia from 709 to 716.\"",

One of the sons of \u00c6thelfrith of Bernicia, Oswiu became king following the death of his brother Oswald in 642. Unlike Oswald, Oswiu struggled to exert authority over Deira, the other constituent kingdom of medieval Northumbria, for much of his reign. Oswiu and his brothers were raised in exile in the Scottish kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata after their father's death at the hands of Edwin of Deira, only returning after Edwin's death in 633. Oswiu rose to the kingship when his brother Oswald was killed in battle against Penda of Mercia. The early part of his reign was defined by struggles to assert control over Deira and his contentious relationship with Penda, his overlord. In 655, Oswiu's forces killed Penda in a decisive victory at the Battle of the Winwaed, establishing Oswiu as one of the most powerful rulers in Britain. He secured control of Deira, with his son Alhfrith serving as a sub-king, and for three years, Oswiu's power extended over Mercia, earning him recognition as \"bretwalda\" over much of Great Britain. Oswiu was a devoted Christian, promoting the faith among his subjects and establishing a number of monasteries, including Gilling Abbey and Whitby Abbey. He was raised in the Celtic Christian tradition of much of the Irish world, rather than the Roman tradition practiced by the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms as well as some members of the Deiran nobility, including Oswiu's queen Eanfl\u00e6d. In 664, Oswiu presided over the Synod of Whitby, where clerics debated over the two traditions, and helped resolve tension between the parties by decreeing that Northumbria would follow the Roman style. Oswiu died in 670 and was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith. His feast is February 15 in the East and in the West.\"",

Baker first met Khan when she attended one of his lectures in San Francisco, after which the pair quickly fell in love. However, resistance from Baker's family prevented them from marrying until 1913, at which point she took the name \"Ameena Begum\". After living in London and Moscow for a time, the family settled in Suresnes, near Paris. She left a collection of 101 poems, \"A Rosary of one hundred and one beads\". Some poems were lost during World War II, but 54 have been preserved and were published in 1998. She was a cousin of Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Christian Science Church in the USA. Hidayat Inayat Khan wrote: \"In 1926, Hazrat Inayat Khan gave my Mother an exceptional initiation as \"Pirani\", which was only to be given to her. That special initiation was not to be given to any one else in the Sufi Movement, either in the present or in the future\". Hazrat Inayat Khan said in his Autobiography that without Ameena Begum's help he would never have been able to bring his Sufi Message to the Western world..\"",

Born in Weimar, Duchess Anna Dorothea was the daughter of John Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and Christine Elisabeth of Holstein-Sonderburg. Her father decided she should pursue an ecclesiastical career when she was still a child. From 1681 until 1684, Anna Dorothea was provost of the Quedlinburg monasteries. Upon the death of Princess-Abbess Anna Sophia II, Anna Dorothea was chosen to succeed her, though not without difficulties that required the intervention of the abbey-principality's guardian and fellow Wettin, John George III, Elector of Saxony. The Elector consented to her election on 4 September 1684 and Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I confirmed it on 29 January 1685. In 1698, Frederick Augustus I, who had succeeded to the Electorate of Saxony in 1694 and had been elected King of Poland in 1697, found himself in need of money as the election had cost him a fortune. The King of Poland therefore decided to sell his rights of guardianship of the abbey-principality to Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg. The change was not welcomed by the citizens of Quedlinburg nor by the Princess-Abbess, as it led to diminishing of her power and loss of many of the abbey-principality's possessions. The Princess-Abbess protested against the sale and refused to recognise the Elector of Brandenburg as the abbey-principality's new guardian until military occupation the same year forced her to do so. As many of her predecessors, she often came into conflicts with the Council of the City of Quedlinburg and her guardian. Anna Dorothea suffered poor health in 1703 and went to Carlsbad to recover, but without success. She died the next year. She is buried in Weimar.\"",

Bergman structured the film as a three-act play, drawing on his personal experiences and relationships. The film was his first of several shot on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6, at the recommendation of cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The score incorporates the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Themes explored include the equation of God with love, exploitation in art, psychosis, and sexuality. \"Through a Glass Darkly\" was released to positive reviews, specifically for Andersson's performance, and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

Through his mother he had royal descent from King Edward III, his great-grandfather, and from his father, he inherited, at an early age, the earldom of Stafford. By his marriage to a daughter of Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, Humphrey was related to the powerful Neville family and to many of the leading aristocratic houses of the time. He joined the English campaign in France with King Henry V in 1420 and following Henry V's death two years later he became a councillor for the new King, the nine-month-old Henry VI. Stafford acted as a peacemaker during the partisan, factional politics of the 1430s, when Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, vied with Cardinal Beaufort for political supremacy. Stafford also took part in the eventual arrest of Gloucester in 1447. Stafford returned to the French campaign during the 1430s and for his loyalty and years of service, he was elevated from Earl of Stafford to Duke of Buckingham. Around the same time, his mother died. As much of his estate\u2014as her dower\u2014had previously been in her hands, Humphrey went from having a reduced income in his early years to being one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in England. His lands stretched across much of the country, ranging from East Anglia to the Welsh border. Being such an important figure in the localities was not without its dangers and for some time he feuded violently with Sir Thomas Malory in the Midlands. After returning from France, Stafford remained in England for the rest of his life, serving King Henry. He acted as the King's bodyguard and chief negotiator during Jack Cade's rebellion of 1450, helping to suppress it. When the King's cousin, Richard, Duke of York, rebelled two years later, Stafford investigated York's followers. In 1453, the King became ill and sank into a catatonic state; law and order broke down further and when civil war began in 1455, Stafford fought for the King in the First Battle of St Albans which began the Wars of the Roses. Both were captured by the Yorkists and Stafford spent most of his final years attempting to mediate between the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions, the latter by now headed by Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou. Partly due to a feud with a leading Yorkist\u2014Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick\u2014Stafford eventually declared for King Henry and the Duke of York was defeated in 1459, driving York into exile. When the rebels returned the following year they attacked the royal army at Northampton. Acting as the King's personal guard in the ensuing struggle, Stafford was killed and the King was again taken prisoner. Stafford's eldest son had died of plague two years earlier and the Buckingham dukedom descended to Stafford's five-year-old grandson, Henry, a ward of the King until he came of age in 1473.\"",

Later, Stafford was one of several men promoted rapidly through the nobility by King Edward IV, to fill the power vacuum left by dead or forfeit Lancastrians. In the West Country it was particularly the forfeitures of the Lancastrian Courtenay family that benefited Stafford. In 1469 he received the Courtenay title of Earl of Devon. Stafford held the comital title for only three months. In July he was sent north to quell a rebellion instigated by the discontented Earl of Warwick. Even though he escaped the disastrous Battle of Edgecote, he was lynched by a mob at Bridgwater on 17 August 1469.

A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence through his formation of a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers (\"ghilm\u0101n\"). This proved useful to his half-brother, Caliph al-Ma'mun, who employed al-Mu'tasim and his Turkish guard to counterbalance other powerful interest groups in the state, as well as employing them in campaigns against rebels and the Byzantine Empire. When al-Ma'mun died unexpectedly on campaign in August 833, al-Mu'tasim was thus well placed to succeed him, overriding the claims of al-Ma'mun's son al-Abbas. Al-Mu'tasim continued many of his brother's policies, such as the partnership with the Tahirids, who ruled Khurasan and Baghdad on behalf of the Abbasids. With the support of the powerful chief \"q\u0101d\u012b\", Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, he continued to implement the rationalist Islamic doctrine of Mu'tazilism and the persecution of its opponents through the inquisition (\"mi\u1e25na\"). Although not personally interested in literary pursuits, al-Mu'tasim also nurtured the scientific renaissance begun under al-Ma'mun. In other ways, his reign marks a departure and a watershed moment in Islamic history, with the creation of a new regime centred on the military, and particularly his Turkish guard. In 836, a new capital was established at Samarra to symbolize this new regime and remove it from the restive populace of Baghdad. The power of the caliphal government was increased by centralizing measures that reduced the power of provincial governors in favour of a small group of senior civil and military officials in Samarra, and the fiscal apparatus of the state was more and more dedicated to the maintenance of the professional army, which was dominated by Turks. The Arab and Iranian elites that had played a major role in the early period of the Abbasid state were increasingly marginalized, and an abortive conspiracy against al-Mu'tasim in favour of al-Abbas in 838 resulted in a widespread purge of their ranks. This strengthened the position of the Turks and their principal leaders, Ashinas, Wasif, Itakh, and Bugha. Another prominent member of al-Mu'tasim's inner circle, the prince of Ushrusana, al-Afshin, fell afoul of his enemies at court and was overthrown and killed in 840/1. The rise of the Turks would eventually result in the troubles of the \"Anarchy at Samarra\" and lead to the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the \"ghul\u0101m\"-based system inaugurated by al-Mu'tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world. Al-Mu'tasim's reign was marked by continuous warfare. The two major internal campaigns of the reign were against the long-running Khurramite uprising of Babak Khorramdin in Adharbayjan, which was suppressed by al-Afshin in 835\u2013837, and against Mazyar, the autonomous ruler of Tabaristan, who had clashed with the Tahirids and risen up in revolt. While his generals led the fight against internal rebellions, al-Mu'tasim himself led the sole major external campaign of the period, in 838 against the Byzantine Empire. His armies defeated Emperor Theophilos and sacked the city of Amorium. The Amorium campaign was widely celebrated, and became a cornerstone of caliphal propaganda, cementing al-Mu'tasim's reputation as a warrior-caliph.\"",

The first multimedia star, Crosby was a leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses from 1931 to 1954. His early career coincided with recording innovations that allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed him, including Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Dick Haymes, and Dean Martin. \"Yank\" magazine said that he was \"the person who had done the most for the morale of overseas servicemen\" during World War II. In 1948, American polls declared him the \"most admired man alive\", ahead of Jackie Robinson and Pope Pius XII. Also in 1948, \"Music Digest\" estimated that his recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music. Crosby won an Oscar for Best Actor for his role as Father Chuck O'Malley in the 1944 motion picture \"Going My Way\" and was nominated for his reprise of the role in \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" opposite Ingrid Bergman the next year, becoming the first of six actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. In 1963, Crosby received the first Grammy Global Achievement Award. He is one of 33 people to have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in the categories of motion pictures, radio, and audio recording. He was also known for his collaborations with longtime friend Bob Hope, starring in the \"Road to...\" films from 1940 to 1962. Crosby influenced the development of the postwar recording industry. After seeing a demonstration of a German broadcast quality reel-to-reel tape recorder brought to America by John T. Mullin, he invested $50,000 in a California electronics company called Ampex to build copies. He then convinced ABC to allow him to tape his shows. He became the first performer to pre-record his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto magnetic tape. Through the medium of recording, he constructed his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, time shifting) used in motion picture production, a practice that became an industry standard. In addition to his work with early audio tape recording, he helped to finance the development of videotape, bought television stations, bred racehorses, and co-owned the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team.\"",

The song was featured in Laurel and Hardy's 1937 film \"Way Out West\". It was performed by Laurel and Hardy with The Avalon Boys and featured a section sung in deep bass by Chill Wills, lip-synced by Stan Laurel in the film, with the last line in falsetto (sung by Rosina Lawrence) after Ollie hit Stan on the head with a mallet. This stage routine was performed by actors Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly as part of the 2019 biographical film \"Stan & Ollie\".

Released as a single, the song reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart, thanks largely to being championed by disc jockey John Peel on his Radio 1 evening show. The song was also recorded by Vivian Stanshall and (as \"Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia\") by Tokyo Blade. The song is featured in the stage play \"The Trail Of The Lonesome Pine\", and is played during the opening credits of the 1936 film adaptation.

Bergman directed over sixty films and documentaries for cinematic release and for television screenings, most of which he also wrote. He also directed over 170 plays. He eventually forged a creative partnership with his cinematographers Gunnar Fischer and Sven Nykvist. Among his company of actors were Harriet and Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, Erland Josephson, Ingrid Thulin and Max von Sydow. Most of his films were set in Sweden, and many films from \"Through a Glass Darkly\" (1961) onward were filmed on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6. Philip French referred to Bergman as \"one of the greatest artists of the 20th century ... he found in literature and the performing arts a way of both recreating and questioning the human condition.\" Director Martin Scorsese commented; \"If you were alive in the 50s and the 60s and of a certain age, a teenager on your way to becoming an adult, and you wanted to make movies , I don't see how you couldn't be influenced by Bergman ...

Shown theatrically in 12 separate weekly \"chapters\", it was the last of the three Universal Flash Gordon serials made between 1936 and 1940.

To avoid confusion with the imported Flash Gordon TV series airing around the same time, they were retitled \"Space SoldiersSpace Soldiers' Trip to Mars\", and \"Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe\". In 1966 \"Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe\" was edited down by King Features Syndicate into two feature-length films for television syndication: \"Purple Death from Outer Space\" and \"Perils from the Planet Mongo\". In the early 1970s, a third feature version was re-edited for the 16 mm home movie market, using story material taken from the entire serial. It bore the title \"Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe\" and later appeared on television during the 1980s. Afterward, all three edited feature-length versions became available through various public-domain video sellers, first on VHS videotape and later on DVD. In the mid-1970s all three complete Universal Flash Gordon serials were shown chapter-by-chapter by PBS stations across the U.S., bringing them to a new generation of science fiction fans, two years before  and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\".

Patterson, son of Wimbledon champion Gerald Patterson, attended his father's school, Scotch College, Melbourne, from 1931 to 1934, and Geelong Grammar School from 1935 to 1941. He was one of a brace of new drivers that emerged after World War II, first appearing in the Australian Grand Prix in 1948 driving a stripped down MG TC. After improving the MG as far as he was able, he moved to a JAP powered Cooper Mk. V in 1953. Patterson used this to win his first national title, the 1954 Australian Hillclimb Championship. In the scorching heat of a Western Australian summer in 1957, Patterson stepped into Lex Davison's Ferrari 625 F1 as a relief driver, working together to defeat Stan Jones to win the 1957 Australian Grand Prix. A succession of grand prix Coopers followed. The biggest year of Patterson's career was 1961. Victories at Mount Panorama, Lowood, Caversham and a second at Longford saw Patterson dominate the 1961 Australian Drivers' Championship, scoring 51 points to Lex Davison's 15 to win the Gold Star. Patterson raced on for a few more years and took part in the inaugural Tasman Series in 1964, but after that Patterson stepped away from the sport as a driver, but stayed as an entrant, sponsor and team boss. Patterson Holden dealership Bill Patterson Motors supported several drivers over the following decades, open wheelers for the rest of the 1960s and on into the 1970s. In 1977 Patterson purchased touring car racing team, Team Brock which he ran for a year. Patterson's name continued to be seen in the sport into the 2000s in Speedway racing. Patterson died at Sandringham on 10 January 2010 at the age of 86.\"",

He also wrote about 500 cabaret songs, chamber music, and orchestral and choral works. His original name was actually Strauss, but for professional purposes he deliberately omitted the final 's', since he wished not to be associated with the musical Strauss family of Vienna. However, he did follow the advice of Johann Strauss II in 1898 about abandoning the prospective lure of writing waltzes for the more lucrative business of writing for the theatre. The son of a Jewish family, he studied music in Berlin under Max Bruch, and became an orchestral conductor, working at the \u00dcberbrettl cabaret. He went back to Vienna and began writing operettas, becoming a serious rival to Franz Leh\u00e1r. When Leh\u00e1r's popular \"The Merry Widow\" premiered in 1905, Straus was said to have remarked \"Das kann ich auch!\" (I can also do that!). In 1939, following the Nazi Anschluss, he fled to Paris, where he received the honour of a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, and then to Hollywood. After the war, he returned to Europe, and settled at Bad Ischl, where he died. His grave is in the Bad Ischl Friedhof. Straus' best-known works are \"Ein WalzertraumA Waltz Dream\"), and \"The Chocolate SoldierDer tapfere Soldat\"). The waltz arrangement from the former is probably his most enduring orchestral work. Among his most famous works is the theme from the 1950 film \"La Ronde\".\"",

In 1987, Ripploh directed a sequel entitled \"Taxi nach Kairo\", but the film was not considered as successful as its predecessor, and it was not released outside Germany. Ripploh also participated in the creation of a small number of other art house films during the 1980s, and had a role in the 1982 movie \"Querelle\" directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder.

She was noted for her humanitarian efforts to save Romanian Jews during World War II, which led to her being awarded by the State of Israel with the honorific of \"Righteous Among the Nations\" in 1993. Daughter of King Constantine I of Greece and his wife, Princess Sophia of Prussia, Princess Helen spent her childhood in Greece, Great Britain and Germany. The outbreak of World War I and the overthrow of her father by the Allies in 1917 permanently marked her and also separated her from her favorite brother, the young Alexander I of Greece. Exiled in Switzerland along with most members of the royal family, Helen then spent several months caring for her father, plagued by disease and depression. In 1920, the princess met Carol, Crown Prince of Romania, who quickly asked her hand in marriage. Despite the bad reputation of the prince, Helen accepted and moved to Romania, where she soon gave birth to their only son, Prince Michael, in 1921. The situation of her family, however, continued to worry Helen, who made several trips abroad to visit her parents when they did not simply reside with her in Bucharest. In doing this, she distanced herself from her husband, whose multiple affairs ended when he fell in love with Magda Lupescu in 1924. Finally, in 1925, Prince Carol abandoned his wife and renounced the throne in order to live openly with his mistress. Distraught, Helen tried to persuade her husband to return to her but eventually she accepted the divorce in 1928. In the meanwhile, Helen was proclaimed \"Queen Mother of Romania\" in 1927, as her son Michael ascended to the throne under the regency of his uncle Prince Nicholas. However, the political situation in Romania was complicated and Carol took advantage of the increased instability to return to Bucharest in 1930 and be acclaimed as king. Soon, the new ruler forced his ex-wife into exile and only authorized her to see their son two months per year. In these circumstances, Helen moved to Villa Sparta at Fiesole, Tuscany. Always close to her family, she hosted her sisters Irene and Katherine and brother Paul, who stayed with her intermittently until the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935. The outbreak of World War II, the deposition of Carol II and the subsequent dismemberment of Greater Romania in 1940, however, brought Helen back to be with her son in Bucharest. Subject to the dictatorship of General Antonescu and vigilance of Nazi Germany, the king and his mother were cautious in their dealings with the fascist regime. They did not show their opposition to the participation of Romania in the invasion of the Soviet Union and the deportation of Jews. Finally, King Michael organized a coup against Antonescu on 23 August 1944 and Romania turned against the Axis powers; however, the country was, in the end, occupied by the Red Army. For Helen and her son, the post-war period was marked by the interference of the Soviet Union in the Romanian political life. In March 1945, the king was forced to accept a communist government headed by Petru Groza while the following year, the general elections confirmed the hegemony of the PCR in the country. Finally, Michael I was forced to abdicate on 30 December 1947 and the royal family took the path of exile. Helen then returned to the Villa Sparta, where she divided her time among her family, gardening and the study of Italian art. Increasingly concerned about her finances, Helen finally left Italy for Switzerland in 1979 and died three years later with her son at her side.\"",

Ch\u00e1vez was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012. Born into a middle class family in Sabaneta, Barinas, Ch\u00e1vez became a career military officer and, after becoming dissatisfied with the Venezuelan political system based on the Puntofijo Pact, founded the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200) in the early 1980s. Ch\u00e1vez led the MBR-200 in an unsuccessful coup d'\u00e9tat against the Democratic Action government of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez in 1992, for which he was imprisoned. Pardoned from prison after two years, he founded a political party known as the Fifth Republic Movement and was elected president of Venezuela in 1998 with 56.2% of the vote. He was re-elected in 2000 with 59.8% of the vote and again in 2006 with 62.8% of the vote. After winning his fourth term as president in the October 2012 presidential election with a decrease to 55.1% of the vote, he was to be sworn in on 10 January 2013. However, the inauguration was postponed due to his cancer treatment, and he died in Caracas on 5 March 2013 at the age of 58. Following the adoption of a new constitution in 1999, Ch\u00e1vez focused on enacting social reforms as part of the Bolivarian Revolution. Using record-high oil revenues of the 2000s, his government nationalized key industries, created participatory democratic Communal Councils and implemented social programs known as the Bolivarian missions to expand access to food, housing, healthcare and education. The high oil profits coinciding with the start of Chavez' presidency resulted in temporary improvements in areas such as poverty, literacy, income equality and quality of life between primarily 2003 and 2007, with a reversal beginning after around 2012; beyond falling oil prices, there are arguments that government policies did not address structural inequalities. On 2 June 2010, Ch\u00e1vez declared an \"economic war\" on Venezuela's upper classes due to shortages, arguably beginning the crisis in Venezuela. By the end of Ch\u00e1vez's presidency in the early 2010s, economic actions performed by his government during the preceding decade, such as deficit spending and price controls, proved to be unsustainable, with Venezuela's economy faltering. At the same time, poverty, inflation and shortages increased. Under Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela experienced democratic backsliding, as he suppressed the press, manipulated electoral laws, and arrested and exiled government critics. His use of enabling acts and his government's use of propaganda were controversial. Ch\u00e1vez's presidency saw significant increases in the country's murder rate and continued corruption within the police force and government. Internationally, Ch\u00e1vez aligned himself with the Marxist\u2013Leninist governments of Fidel and then Ra\u00fal Castro in Cuba, as well as the socialist governments of Evo Morales (Bolivia), Rafael Correa (Ecuador) and Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua). His presidency was seen as a part of the socialist \"pink tide\" sweeping Latin America. Ch\u00e1vez described his policies as anti-imperialist, being a prominent adversary of the United States's foreign policy as well as a vocal critic of U.S.-supported neoliberalism and \"laissez-faire\" capitalism. He described himself as a Marxist. He supported Latin American and Caribbean cooperation and was instrumental in setting up the pan-regional Union of South American Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, the Bank of the South and the regional television network TeleSUR. Chavez's ideas, programs, and style form the basis of \"Chavismo\", a political ideology closely associated with Bolivarianism and socialism of the 21st century.\"",

They were sons of architect William Adam. In 1755 James worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth. In 1758, Robert, James, and their younger brother William Adam started their business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers' success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs. He then followed in Robert's footsteps by undertaking the \"Grand Tour\", leaving in May 1760 to October 1763, when he arrive back in London. James succeeded Robert as Architect of the King's Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers' Adelphi project (1768\u20131772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739\u20131808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781). From 1771\u20135 he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire. James emerged from his brother's shadow after Robert's death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. However, his glory was short-lived \u2014 he died at his home in London's Albermarle Street in October 1794. During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, \"Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam\" (in 1773\u20131778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).\"",

He was born in Pella in 356 BC and succeeded his father Philip II to the throne at the age of 20. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. During his youth, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle until age 16. After Philip's assassination in 336 BC, he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. Alexander was awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father's pan-Hellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of Persia. In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Empire (Persian Empire) and began a series of campaigns that lasted 10 years. Following the conquest of Anatolia, Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela. He subsequently overthrew Persian King Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. At that point, his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Beas River. Alexander endeavoured to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" and invaded India in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the Pauravas at the Battle of the Hydaspes. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops, dying in Babylon in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the Diadochi: Alexander's surviving generals and heirs. Alexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism. He founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization, aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles, and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves, and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics. He is often ranked among the most influential people in history.\"",

For much of the Napoleonic Wars he was in command of the Austrian army. Ferdinand was born at Milan. He attended the military academy in Wiener Neustadt before embarking on a military career. In 1805 in the war of the Third Coalition against France, Ferdinand was commander-in-chief of the Austrian forces with General Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich as his quartermaster general. In October his army was surrounded at Ulm. General Mack surrendered, but Ferdinand managed to escape with 2000 cavalry to Bohemia. There he took command of the Austrian troops and raised the local militia. With a total of 9,000 men he set out for Iglau to distract attention from the Coalition's movements. He succeeded in holding the Bavarian division of Prince Karl Philipp von Wrede in Iglau thereby and preventing it from joining the Battle of Austerlitz. In 1809 in the war of the Fifth Coalition against France, Ferdinand commanded an Austrian army of 36,000 men. In April he invaded the Duchy of Warsaw hoping to encourage a local uprising against Napoleon (see Polish\u2013Austrian War). But the Poles rallied to Prince J\u00f3zef Antoni Poniatowski. Ferdinand was defeated at the Battle of Raszyn, but managed to occupy Warsaw. In June, however, Ferdinand was compelled to withdraw from Warsaw, and to give up Krak\u00f3w and Galicia as well. In 1815 in the war of the Seventh Coalition against France, Ferdinand commanded two divisions of the Austrian Reserve. The following year he was appointed military commander in Hungary. In 1830 Ferdinand was appointed military and civil governor of Galicia, taking up residence in Lviv. After the Revolution of 1848 he resided mostly in Italy. Ferdinand never married.

The latter also appointed Abd al-Aziz governor of Jund Dimashq (District of Damascus). Abd al-Aziz's mother was Umm al-Banin, a daughter of al-Walid's paternal uncle, Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan. He was regarded by his father as \"the \"sayyid\", the most forceful personality, amongst his sons\". Abd al-Aziz led his first campaign against the Byzantines in Asia Minor in 709, when he captured a fortress, although his uncle Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik led the main raid of the year afterwards. In 710 he led the main Umayyad attack, although under the auspices of Maslama as commander-in-chief for the Byzantine front, and in 713 he led an attack against the frontier fortress of Gazelon. In 714/15, his father attempted to reverse the succession arrangement, by which the throne would pass to his brother Sulayman, in favour of Abd al-Aziz. In addition to various officials and poets in al-Walid's court, Abd al-Aziz gained the support of the powerful viceroy of the eastern half of the Caliphate, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, who died in 714, the governor of Khurasan, Qutayba ibn Muslim, and a prominent Alid of Medina, Zayd, the son of Hasan ibn Ali. Nonetheless, he was unable to impose his will. When Sulayman in turn died in northern Syria in 717, Abd al-Aziz intended to claim the throne in Damascus, but upon learning that his maternal uncle Umar II had been chosen as caliph, he presented himself before him and acknowledged his rule. According to the account of al-Waqidi, during their encounter, Umar informed Abd al-Aziz that he would not have disputed his accession, to which Abd al-Aziz replied: \"I would not like anyone else but you to have taken over the office\". Abd al-Aziz died in Anno Hegirae 110 (728/729 CE).\"",

Al-Walid was the eldest son of his predecessor Caliph Abd al-Malik . While still a prince, he led annual raids against the Byzantines in 695\u2013698 and built or restored fortifications along the Syrian Desert route to Mecca. He became the heir apparent after the death of Abd al-Malik's brother and designated successor, Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan, in 704. Al-Walid largely continued his father's policies of centralization and expansion, and heavily depended on al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, his father's powerful viceroy over the eastern half of the Caliphate. During his reign, Umayyad armies conquered the Maghreb, Hispania, Sind and Transoxiana, expanding the Caliphate to its largest territorial extent. War spoils from the conquests allowed al-Walid to finance public works of great magnitude, including the Great Mosque of Damascus, the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. He was the first caliph to institute programs for social welfare, aiding the poor and handicapped in Syria. Though it is difficult to ascertain al-Walid's direct role in the affairs of his caliphate, his reign was marked by domestic peace and prosperity and likely represented the peak of Umayyad power.\"",

His scientific and medical works are not considered particularly enlightened by modern medical scholars (he has sometimes been compared to the doctors in the works of Moli\u00e8re). He is most well known today for his extensive correspondence: his style was light and playful (he has been compared to early 17th century philosophical libertines), and his letters are an important document for historians of medicine. Patin and his son Charles were also dealers in clandestine books, and Patin wrote occasional poetry (such as a quatrain to honor Henric Piccardt (1636-1712)). On 22 March 1648, Patin wrote a famous letter commenting on the new rage of tea drinking in Paris, calling it \"the impertinent novelty of the century\", and mentioning the new book by Dr. Philibert Morisset titled \"Ergo Thea Chinesium, Menti Confert\" (Does Chinese Tea Increase Mentality?), which praises tea as a panacea: One of our doctors, named Morisset, who is much more of a braggart than a skilful man... caused a thesis on tea to be published here.

He was the second son of Charles the Bald and brother of Louis the Stammerer. The younger Charles was appointed by his father, who had previously ruled as King of Aquitaine himself from 838, as a sop to Aquitainian separatism. The Aquitainians had previously rebelled against Charles the Bald, requesting from Louis the German that he send one of his sons to rule over them. Louis had sent his second son, Louis the Younger, prompting Charles the Bald to release his rival claimant to Aquitaine, Pippin II. Pippin succeeded in rallying the nobles to support himself and Charles the Bald against Louis the Younger, who was driven out. By October, however, Pippin lost his popularity with the still- rebellious Aquitainians, prompting Charles the Bald to appoint Charles the Child as King. Charles the Child was duly anointed at Limoges. Within a year, he had been replaced by the Aquitainians with Pippin II. These same then deposed Pippin and restored Charles the Child. Pippin was captured in 864 and imprisoned at Senlis, at which point he disappears from history. Unlike previous sub-kings of Aquitaine,( Louis the Pious, Pippin I, Pippin II), Charles the Child had no real authority at all. Before 840, the kingdom had been ruled in person by an autonomous king; Charles the Bald, however, after his accession as King of Western Francia, attempted to maintain power in Aquitaine. Consequently, Charles the Child, and his brother, Louis the Stammerer, did not rule in person, had no chancery, could issue no instruments; they were no longer empowered to bestow privileges, endow religious establishments, or dispose of royal property. All the rights of the region were invested in Charles the Bald, in whose absence the nobles of the Kingdom gathered power. Nonetheless, as Charles grew older, he began to exercise what little personal authority he could. For example, in 862 he chose and married a wife against the will of his father. The name of his wife is unknown, although she was apparently the widow of a count named Humbert. Charles the Bald reasserted his power over his son in 863, forcing the younger Charles to put away his wife and be loyal to his father. A year later, he was accidentally struck with a sword in the head by a member of his own hunting party in a mock combat, leading Ado of Vienne to say that\" Charles was dishonoured(\" dehonestatus\") by having suffered it\". The blow left him mentally incapacitated until his resultant death in 866. He died childless and was buried in Bourges.\"",

He was the only son of Louis, Prince of Piacenza, and his wife Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain. Born at the Royal Palace of Madrid at the court of his maternal grandfather King Charles IV of Spain, he spent his first years living at the Spanish court. In 1801, by the Treaty of Aranjuez, Charles became Crown Prince of Etruria, a newly created kingdom formed from territories of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Charles moved to Italy with his parents and in 1803, not yet four years old, he succeeded his father as King of Etruria under the name Charles Louis I. His mother Infanta Maria Luisa assumed the regency while Charles Louis' minority lasted. In 1807 Napoleon Bonaparte dissolved the kingdom of Etruria and Charles Louis and his mother took refuge in Spain. In May 1808 they were forced to leave Spain by Napoleon who arrested Charles Louis' mother in a convent in Rome. Between 1811 and 1814 Charles Louis was placed under the care of his grandfather, the deposed King Charles IV of Spain. After Napoleon's fall, in 1817, Infanta Maria Luisa became Duchess of Lucca in her own right and Charles Louis, age sixteen, became hereditary Prince of Lucca. In 1820 he married Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy. They were a mismatched couple and had only one surviving son. At his mother's death in 1824, Charles Louis became the reigning Duke of Lucca as Charles I. He had little interest in ruling. He left the duchy in the hands of his ministers and spent most of his time traveling around Europe. A liberal movement led him to abdicate Lucca in favor of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in October 1847 in exchange for financial compensation, as he wanted to retire to private life. Two months later, in December 1847, at the death of the former Empress Marie Louise, he succeeded her as the reigning Duke of Parma according to what had been stipulated by the Congress of Vienna. His reign in Parma as Duke Charles II was brief. He was ill- received by his new subjects and within a few months he was ousted by a revolution. He regained control of Parma under the protection of Austrian troops, but finally abdicated in favor of his son Charles III on 14 March 1849. His son was assassinated in 1854 and his grandson Robert I, the last reigning Duke of Parma, was deposed in 1860. In exile Charles Louis assumed the title of count of Villafranca. He spent the last years of his life mostly in France, dying at Nice on 16 April 1883.\"",

It stars Henry Fonda, cast against type, as the villain, Charles Bronson as his nemesis, Claudia Cardinale as a newly widowed homesteader, and Jason Robards as a bandit. The screenplay was written by Sergio Donati and Leone, from a story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci and Leone. The widescreen cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the acclaimed film score was by Ennio Morricone. After directing\" The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", Leone decided to retire from Westerns and desired to produce his film based on\" The Hoods\", which eventually became\" Once Upon a Time in America\". However, Leone accepted an offer from Paramount Pictures to provide access to Henry Fonda and to use a budget to produce another Western film. He recruited Bertolucci and Argento to devise the plot of the film in 1966, researching other Western films in the process. After Clint Eastwood turned down an offer to play the movie's protagonist, Bronson was offered the role. During production, Leone recruited Donati to rewrite the script due to concerns over time limitations. The original version by the director was 166 minutes( 2 hours and 46 minutes) when it was first released on 21 December 1968. This was the version that was to be shown in European cinemas and was a box office success. For the US release on 28 May 1969,\" Once Upon a Time in the West\" was edited down to 145 minutes( 2 hours and 25 minutes) by Paramount and was a financial flop. The film is the first installment in Leone's\" Once Upon a Time Trilogy\", followed by\" Duck, You Sucker!\" and\" Once Upon a Time in America\", though the films do not share any characters in common. In 2009, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being\" culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\"",

Born in Weimar, Duchess Anna Dorothea was the daughter of John Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and Christine Elisabeth of Holstein-Sonderburg. Her father decided she should pursue an ecclesiastical career when she was still a child. From 1681 until 1684, Anna Dorothea was provost of the Quedlinburg monasteries. Upon the death of Princess-Abbess Anna Sophia II, Anna Dorothea was chosen to succeed her, though not without difficulties that required the intervention of the abbey-principality's guardian and fellow Wettin, John George III, Elector of Saxony. The Elector consented to her election on 4 September 1684 and Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I confirmed it on 29 January 1685. In 1698, Frederick Augustus I, who had succeeded to the Electorate of Saxony in 1694 and had been elected King of Poland in 1697, found himself in need of money as the election had cost him a fortune. The King of Poland therefore decided to sell his rights of guardianship of the abbey-principality to Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg. The change was not welcomed by the citizens of Quedlinburg nor by the Princess-Abbess, as it led to diminishing of her power and loss of many of the abbey-principality's possessions. The Princess-Abbess protested against the sale and refused to recognise the Elector of Brandenburg as the abbey-principality's new guardian until military occupation the same year forced her to do so. As many of her predecessors, she often came into conflicts with the Council of the City of Quedlinburg and her guardian. Anna Dorothea suffered poor health in 1703 and went to Carlsbad to recover, but without success. She died the next year. She is buried in Weimar.\"",

He was the illegitimate son of stadholder Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange and his mistress Margaretha van Mechelen. Like their other illegitimate children, he was recognized with the surname Nassau- LaLecq. He went by the title Rijksgraaf( Count of the Holy Roman Empire) van Nassau- LaLecq\" and was also popularly known in French as the\" Chevalier de Nassau\". After 1625 he was granted lands and the title Lord of De Lek. He received his heerlijkheid of De Lek as a bequest from his father to him and his descendants. His brother Lodewijk van Nassau had the title\" Lord of Beverweerd and Odijk\". From his 19th year on, Willem served in the Dutch army fighting Spain in the Dutch Revolt( 1568 \u2013 1648). Aged only 24 he received the rank of lieutenant- admiral of Holland and West Friesland, replacing stadholder Frederik Hendrik. He led the Dutch ships that participated in the C\u00e1diz expedition of 1625. In the summer of 1627 he was present at the Siege of Grol. On the 18 August, not long before the end of the siege, fighting with the French troops at the front, Willem received a bullet wound which later proved fatal. Thus he died on his 27th birthday, with Lodewijk inheriting Willem's fiefdom. On 4 April 1627, 4 months before his death, Willem married Anna van der Noot, lady of Hoogwoud and Aartswoud, in Sluis. Though he had no children with Anna, he had one illegitimate son by Barbara Augustinus Cocx, Willem Jonker van Nassau( 1620- 1679).\"",

It was adapted for the screen by writer Walter Bernstein and director Ritchie, who added a new storyline that included a satire of the self-help movement and new religions. \"Semi-Tough\" follows the story of pro football friends Billy Clyde Puckett and Marvin \"Shake\" Tiller, who have a third roommate, Barbara Jane Bookman. A romance develops with Shake until he becomes self-confident after completing a self awareness course called \"B.E.A.T.\" led by Friedrich Bismark that he insists Barbara Jane try, at which point Billy Clyde slyly makes a play to win her for himself. The film received mixed receptions. Some reviewers praised its parodies of the est training, Erhard and other new age movements such as Rolfing. Others criticized the script and direction, noting that some of director Ritchie's previous films had more of a personal tone. Still other reviews lamented the film's departure from the novel \"Semi-Tough\", which dealt more with football and less with the new age movement.\"",

The album debuted at the top of the Oricon charts and remained there for five weeks, selling over a million copies. Her next ten albums shipped over a million copies in Japan, with her third, \"Duty,\" selling nearly three million. \" A Best\", her first compilation album, is her best-selling album, with more than four million copies sold in Japan. Since 2006, after her album \"Secret\" was released, album and single sales have declined. Hamasaki has sold over 80 million records, making her the best-selling Japanese solo artist of all time. During the height of her career, Hamasaki was dubbed the \"Empress of J-pop\" because of her popularity in Japan and Asia. Following an ear infection in 2000, she has suffered worsening hearing loss and is completely deaf in one ear.\"",

It was released worldwide in six different formats on December 25, 2013 by Avex Trax, Avex Taiwan, and Avex Entertainment Inc. It was also Hamasaki's first physical release in three years since her EP\u2013single \"L\" (2010), and her first double A-side single, alongside the track \"Feel the Love\", since \"Moon\" and \"Blossom\" that same year. The track was written by Hamasaki, whilst production was handled by Japanese musician and long-time collaborator Max Matsuura with the assistance of M-Flo; this marks Hamasaki's first single to be produced with another producer outside of Matsuura. Musically, \"Merry-Go-Round\" is an electronic dance song that includes guitars and synthesizers in its instrumentation. Upon its release, \"Merry-Go-Round\" received favorable reviews from music critics. The majority of them praised the composition, production, and Hamasaki's vocal performance, whilst others also highlighted the track as one of the best entries on \"Colours\". Charting together with \"Feel the Love\", it underperformed in Japan, reaching number five on the Oricon Singles Chart, and was her first single to miss the top spot since her single \"Daybreak\" twelve years earlier. Two accompanying music videos were shot by Luis Hernandez and Satoru Yokoyama, which featured Hamasaki in Los Angeles, California at the top of a skyscraper, and her with another man; the Yokoyama version also included an appearance with Verbal. To promote the single, Hamasaki performed the track on her 2013\u20132014 Countdown live tour.\"",

Atang de la Rama was born in Pandacan, Manila on January 11, 1902. By the age of 7, she was already starring in Spanish \"zarzuelas\" such as \"MascotaSue\u00f1o de un Vals\", and \"Marina\". At the age of 15, she starred in the sarsuela \"Dalagang Bukid\", where she became known for singing the song, \"Nabasag na Banga\". During the American occupation of the Philippines, Atang de la Rama fought for the dominance of the \"kundiman\", an important Philippine folk song, and the \"sarsuela\", which is a musical play that focused on contemporary Filipino issues such as usury, cockfighting, and colonial mentality. Generations of Filipino artists and audiences consider Atang de la Rama's vocal and acting talents as responsible for much of the success of original Filipino sarsuelas like \"Dalagang Bukid\", and dramas like \"Veronidia\". She has also been a theatrical producer, writer and talent manager. She was the producer and the writer of plays such as \"Anak ni Eva\" and \"Bulaklak ng Kabundukan\". For her achievements and contributions to the art form, she was hailed Queen of the Kundiman and of the Sarsuela in 1979, at the age of 74. Atang believed that art should be for everyone; not only did she perform in major Manila theaters such as the \"Teatro Libertad\" and the \"Teatro Zorilla\", but also in cockpits and open plazas in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. She also made an effort to bring the kundiman and sarsuela to the indigenous peoples of the Philippine such as the Igorots, the Aetas, and the Mangyans. She was also at the forefront of introducing Filipino culture to foreign audiences. At the height of her career, she sang kundimans and other Filipino songs in concerts in such cities as Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo. On May 8, 1987, \"for her sincere devotion to original Filipino theater and music, her outstanding artistry as singer, and as sarsuela actress-playwright-producer, her tireless efforts to bring her art to all sectors of Filipino society and to the world,\" President Corazon C. Aquino proclaimed Atang de la Rama a National Artist of the Philippines for Theater and Music. Atang de la Rama died on July 11, 1991. She was married to National Artist for Literature, Amado V. Hernandez.\"",

In 1622, aged 20, he married his 14- year- old aunt Ana Mar\u00eda de Guzm\u00e1n( 1607 \u2013 1637), having four children by her, of which only the youngest, Gaspar Juan, survived to inherit the title. In 1639, the 9th Duke was married for a second time to Seville noblewoman Juana Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, but only after signing documents giving the considerable amount of 20,000 Ducados to Margarita Mara\u00f1on, on condition she become a nun near his palace in Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, later in a Dominican convent. It is said she was the mother of his illegitimate daughter, Luisa. In 1640, his sister Luisa of Guzman became the new Queen of Portugal, as the wife of the former Duke of Braganza, now John IV of Portugal. In 1641 the 9th Duke led the Andalusian rebellion against Spanish rule. Though both Portugal and Catalonia had strong cultural identities, an historical record of independence, and popular support, Andalusia did not, and the rebellion failed. The duke had the support of his brother- in- law, John IV of Portugal, but the promised naval aid from France and the Netherlands did not arrive. The king of Spain forgave his treason, but the previous prestige of his house was only regained by his successor.\"",

He was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, but he spent most of his adult life in Mexico City, where he died. On 1932, while in New York City, Fernando Cort\u00e9s married Puerto Rican childhood friend Mar\u00eda del Pilar Cordero, who adopted the stage name of Mapy Cort\u00e9s. The couple soon traveled to Spain with a Cuban theatrical troupe. They worked on the Spanish stage, radio and film until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936. Fernando progressively began to take a backseat as actor and baritone and focused on promoting the career of his wife Mapy, who became a noted \"vedette\" (showgirl with star status) in Barcelona. After the Spanish Civil War interrupted their careers, the couple worked in New York, San Juan, Buenos Aires, Havana and Caracas, occasionally starring in movies. They arrived to Mexico City in late 1940 and made their stage debut at the Teatro Follies, in a show headlined by the popular Mexican comedian Cantinflas. Despite early struggles to become household names, Mapy achieved Mexican film stardom in late 1941 and the couple settled in Mexico City. Initially, Fernando Cort\u00e9s played supporting roles in his wife's films. He then made a successful debut as director with \"La p\u00edcara Susana\" (1945) a comedy vehicle for his wife. On March 1954, Fernando and Mapy Cort\u00e9s returned to Puerto Rico to help launch local television. Cort\u00e9s became the first director at WKAQ-TV, Channel 2, and the couple co-starred in \"Mapy y Papi\", the first Puerto Rican sitcom. Despite their success on local TV, the couple returned the following year to Mexico City, which offered more opportunities. The couple starred in a Mexican version of their Puerto Rican sitcom and Mapy returned to the stage. Fernando Cort\u00e9s became known as a reliable director of Mexican comedies on stage, television and film. After writing and directing star vehicles for his wife Mapy in the 1940s and comedians like Resortes and Tin-Tan in the 1950s, Fernando Cort\u00e9s produced and directed Puerto Rican co-productions in the 1960s and launched the film career of La India Mar\u00eda in the 1970s.\"",

Friend and patron of living artists and collectors, he was the son of a picture dealer and the brother-in-law of Sir Joseph Duveen. His witty and acerbic journal, kept for twenty-one years and published posthumously as \"Journal d'un collectionneur: marchand de tableaux\" (1963, revised edition 2011), with a preface by Jean Gu\u00e9henno of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, was translated and published in English as \"Diary of an Art Dealer\" (1966), and is a primary source for the history of modern art and of collecting between the World Wars. Trained in the classic traditions of connoisseurship, a great admirer of Chardin and in general the works of the French eighteenth century, Gimpel had an instinctive sympathy for the modern contemporaries among whom he moved: Georges Braque, Mary Cassatt, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and above all, his intimate friend Marie Laurencin. A friend of Marcel Proust, whom he met at Cabourg in 1907, he had a selective high regard for many museum professionals but a loathing of the experts who provided attributions and certificates of authenticity for paintings in the market. In 1902 his father, Ernest Gimpel, opened E. Gimpel & Wildenstein in New York; the firm would continue in partnership until 1919. In 1905 Ernest and Nathan Wildenstein began negotiating to buy a selection of the magnificent Paris collection of Rodolphe Kann from Kann's estate; however, the powerful firm of Duveen Bros muscled in and bought out their interest, eventually acquiring the entire collection in 1906 for 21 million francs (or over $US4 million), including what were considered in those days twelve Rembrandts. While breaking up the Kann collection and selling it on was a protracted process for the Duveens, E. Gimpel & Wildenstein (Paris and New York) benefited. Ren\u00e9 Gimpel's repeated trips to the United States from 1902 resulted in significant sales to wealthy North American collectors, some of whom he skewered in his private diaries as showing off their artworks \"like rich children showing off their toys\". In May 1919, three weeks of concentrated trading on behalf of E. Gimpel & Wildenstein resulted in sales of five paintings, including Rembrandt's \"Portrait of Titus\" to Jules Bache (now Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, as \"Man in a Red Cloak\", style of Rembrandt), a tapestry \"Saint Veronica\" to Mrs Florence Blumenthal (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and a Houdon portrait bust to C. Ledyard Blair, \"Armand-Thomas Hue, Marquis de Miromesnil\", Frick Collection, New York for $730,000. During World War II Gimpel was interned by the Vichy authorities for his activities in the Resistance, released in 1942, but then re-arrested. In confinement he taught English to his fellow prisoners, in preparation, he said, for their coming liberation. He was sent to Neuengamme concentration camp, near Hamburg, Germany, where his health gave out under the strenuous conditions under which he was held.\"",

Cl\u00e9rico is credited with reviving the popularity of the Moulin Rouge over the course of fifty years. Cl\u00e9rico was born in Paris, France, on March 18, 1929. In 1928, his father, Joseph Cl\u00e9rico, a glassmaker, had moved to Paris from the Piedmont region with his brother, Louis Cl\u00e9rico. The brothers had opened a Parisian glass shop. Joseph and Louis made much of their family's fortune during the German occupation of Paris during World War II, when there was a shortage of glassmakers in the city. The Cl\u00e9ricos were hired to make glass for cities throughout France and Germany which had suffered bombing damage. They had both acquired considerable wealth through their repairs by the end of the war. The brothers purchased the Le Lido cabaret on the Champs- \u00c9lys\u00e9es in 1946. In 1955, Joseph and Louis purchased the Moulin Rouge. They upgraded the kitchens and marketed the venue as a tourist destination. Still, the Moulin Rouge continued to suffer from financial distress by the early 1960s. Jacki Cl\u00e9rico took over the Moulin Rouge in 1962 from his father, Joseph. Cl\u00e9rico built a new aquarium for performances, expanded the auditorium, and introduced professional theater backdrops and scenery. His first revue,\" Frou- Frou,\" opened to sold out audiences in 1963. From that point on, Jacki Cl\u00e9rico only opened revues beginning with the letter\" F\" in keeping with a superstition that the letter brought luck beginning with\" Frou- Frou\". His other revues, included\" Frisson\"( 1965),\" Fascination\"( 1967),\" Fantastic\"( 1970),\" Festival\"( 1973),\" Follement\"( 1976),\" Fr\u00e9n\u00e9sie\"( 1979),\" Femmes, Femmes, Femmes ...\"( 1983), followed this tradition. The music of these revues was composed by Henri Betti. In 1989, Clerico opened\" Formidable\" to mark the 100th anniversary of the Moulin Rouge. Guests included Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. The Moulin Rouge began to lose popularity again during the 1990s. Cl\u00e9rico continued to produce the Moulin Rouge's trademark revues, but the cabaret nearly went bankrupt in 1997. The last show that Cl\u00e9rico produced was\" F\u00e9erie\" in 1999, which featured one hundred dancers. The release of Baz Luhrmann's\" Moulin Rouge!\" in 2001, which starred Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, and Jim Broadbent, revived the club's popularity. The Moulin Rouge is now marketed as a family- oriented destination. Jacki Cl\u00e9rico turned over the day- to- day operations of the Moulin Rouge to his son, Jean- Jacques Cl\u00e9rico, during his later years. He served as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Moulin Rouge until shortly before his death. Cl\u00e9rico died on January 13, 2013, at the age of 83.\"",

Atang de la Rama was born in Pandacan, Manila on January 11, 1902. By the age of 7, she was already starring in Spanish \"zarzuelas\" such as \"MascotaSue\u00f1o de un Vals\", and \"Marina\". At the age of 15, she starred in the sarsuela \"Dalagang Bukid\", where she became known for singing the song, \"Nabasag na Banga\". During the American occupation of the Philippines, Atang de la Rama fought for the dominance of the \"kundiman\", an important Philippine folk song, and the \"sarsuela\", which is a musical play that focused on contemporary Filipino issues such as usury, cockfighting, and colonial mentality. Generations of Filipino artists and audiences consider Atang de la Rama's vocal and acting talents as responsible for much of the success of original Filipino sarsuelas like \"Dalagang Bukid\", and dramas like \"Veronidia\". She has also been a theatrical producer, writer and talent manager. She was the producer and the writer of plays such as \"Anak ni Eva\" and \"Bulaklak ng Kabundukan\". For her achievements and contributions to the art form, she was hailed Queen of the Kundiman and of the Sarsuela in 1979, at the age of 74. Atang believed that art should be for everyone; not only did she perform in major Manila theaters such as the \"Teatro Libertad\" and the \"Teatro Zorilla\", but also in cockpits and open plazas in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. She also made an effort to bring the kundiman and sarsuela to the indigenous peoples of the Philippine such as the Igorots, the Aetas, and the Mangyans. She was also at the forefront of introducing Filipino culture to foreign audiences. At the height of her career, she sang kundimans and other Filipino songs in concerts in such cities as Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo. On May 8, 1987, \"for her sincere devotion to original Filipino theater and music, her outstanding artistry as singer, and as sarsuela actress-playwright-producer, her tireless efforts to bring her art to all sectors of Filipino society and to the world,\" President Corazon C. Aquino proclaimed Atang de la Rama a National Artist of the Philippines for Theater and Music. Atang de la Rama died on July 11, 1991. She was married to National Artist for Literature, Amado V.

In North America, it was also issued as the B-side of the album's lead single,\" Blow Away\", while in Britain and some other markets it was the B-side of the follow- up,\" Love Comes to Everyone\". The lyrics recall Harrison's experiences under the hallucinatory effects of magic mushrooms while holidaying on the Hawaiian island of Maui. The song title refers to Hana, a remote town on the island, and is a play on that of the 1920s ragtime tune\" Hard Hearted Hannah\". Harrison began writing the song in Los Angeles in response to Ted Templeman, a staff producer at Warner Bros. Records, suggesting he compose something in a similar style to his 1971 track\" Deep Blue\". He wrote the lyrics in Hawaii in February 1978, during the main writing period for\" George Harrison\", his first album in over two years. Recorded at Harrison's FPSHOT studio in Oxfordshire, the track features dobro, jazz piano, tuba and prominent chorus vocals, as well as voices and sounds captured in his local pub. The musical arrangement recalls the music hall tradition, while the composition's old- time qualities reflect Harrison's earliest influences from the pre-rock and roll era. The other musicians on the recording include Neil Larsen and Stevie Winwood. The song's lyrics employ, variously, psychedelic imagery, rhyming slang, humorous non sequiturs and John Keats- like symbolism. The song was well received by several music critics and revealed a comedic side of Harrison that was relatively unfamiliar to listeners. Author Simon Leng recognises\" Soft- Hearted Hana\" as the start of the\" Pythonization of Harrison's music\", referring to the Monty Python comedy troupe and Harrison's role as a film producer of British comedies such as\" Monty Python's Life of Brian\".\"",

John III became Regent of the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg in 1521, and Lord of Ravensberg in 1528. John represented a compensatory attitude, which strove for a , a middle way, between the two confessions during the Protestant Reformation. Despite what others may have thought, not all Germanic princely houses were Lutheran Protestant. In fact the real influence at the court of Cleves was Erasmus. Many of his men were friends and followers of this well-educated Dutch scholar and theologian. When Duke John decided to write up a list of church regulations, Erasmus was the first person the Duke went to personally for consultation and approval. Duke John had an instinct for balance as was shown when he married his eldest daughter Sybille to John Frederick of Saxony. John Frederick would go on to later head the Schmalkaldic League. In many ways John of Cleves' court was ideal for raising a Queen. It was fundamentally liberal, but serious-minded, theologically inclined, profoundly Erasmian; as the court of Catherine of Aragon had once been. It was from this court that his daughter Anne would be raised. Anne would go on to marry King Henry VIII of England as his fourth wife.\"",

Born and raised in Tbilisi, the multicultural capital of Georgia, Khachaturian moved to Moscow in 1921 following the Sovietization of the Caucasus. Without prior music training, he enrolled in the Gnessin Musical Institute, subsequently studying at the Moscow Conservatory in the class of Nikolai Myaskovsky, among others. His first major work, the Piano Concerto (1936), popularized his name within and outside the Soviet Union. It was followed by the Violin Concerto (1940) and the Cello Concerto (1946). His other significant compositions include the \"Masquerade Suite\" (1941), the Anthem of the Armenian SSR (1944), three symphonies (1935, 1943, 1947), and around 25 film scores. Khachaturian is best known for his ballet music\u2014\"Gayane\" (1942) and \"Spartacus\" (1954). His most popular piece, the \"Sabre Dance\" from \"Gayane\", has been used extensively in popular culture and has been covered by a number of musicians worldwide. His style is \"characterized by colorful harmonies, captivating rhythms, virtuosity, improvisations, and sensuous melodies\". During most of his career, Khachaturian was approved by the Soviet government and held several high posts in the Union of Soviet Composers from the late 1930s, although he joined the Communist Party only in 1943. Along with Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich, he was officially denounced as a \"formalist\" and his music dubbed \"anti-people\" in 1948 but was restored later that year. After 1950 he taught at the Gnessin Institute and the Moscow Conservatory and turned to conducting. He traveled to Europe, Latin America and the United States with concerts of his own works. In 1957 Khachaturian became the Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers, a position he held until his death. Khachaturian, who created the first Armenian ballet music, symphony, concerto, and film score, is considered the most renowned Armenian composer of the 20th century. While following the established musical traditions of Russia, he broadly used Armenian and, to lesser extent, Caucasian, Eastern and Central European, and Middle Eastern peoples' folk music in his works. He is highly regarded in Armenia, where he is considered a \"national treasure\".\"",

                "page_content": "\"Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome\tInauguration of the Pleasure Dome is a 38- minute short film by Kenneth Anger, filmed in 1954. Anger created two other versions of this film in 1966 and the late 1970s. According to him, the film takes the name\" pleasure dome\" from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's atmospheric poem\" Kubla Khan\". Anger was inspired to make the film after attending a Halloween party called\" Come as your Madness\". The film has gained cult film status. Earlier prints of the film had sequences that were meant to be projected on three different screens, an idea inspired in part by Abel Gance's Napol\u00e9on( 1927 film). The three- screen version was shown at the Brussels World's Fair. Anger subsequently re-edited the film to layer the images. The film( primarily in the second or third version) was often shown in American universities and art galleries during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The original edition soundtrack is a complete performance of\" Glagolitic Mass\" by the Czech composer Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek( 1854 \u2013 1928). In 1966, a re-edited version known as' The Sacred Mushroom Edition' was made available. In the late 1970s, a third revision was made, which was' The Sacred Mushroom Edition' re-edited to fit the Electric Light Orchestra album\" Eldorado\", omitting only\" Illusions in G Major\", a blues- rock tune that Anger felt did not fit the mood of the film. The differences in the visuals of the 1954 original and the two revisions are minor. An early version \u2014shown only once on German television in the early 1980s, and held to this day by NDR\u2014includes an additional three minutes at the beginning, including a reading of the poem\" Kubla Khan\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The film reflects Anger's deep interest in Thelema, the philosophy of Aleister Crowley and his followers, as indicated by Marjorie Cameron's role as\" The Scarlet Woman\"( an honorific Crowley bestowed on certain of his important magical partners). Crowley's concept of a ritual masquerade party where attendees dress as gods and goddesses served as a direct inspiration for the film. The film uses some footage of the Hell sequence from the 1911 Italian silent film\" L'Inferno\". Near the end, scenes from Anger's earlier film\" Puce Moment\" are interpolated into the layered images and faces.\"",

Directed by Jon Favreau and written by Justin Theroux, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/ Iron Man, alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, and Samuel L. Jackson. Six months after the events of\" Iron Man\", Tony Stark is resisting calls by the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology while also combating his declining health from the arc reactor in his chest. Meanwhile, rogue Russian scientist Ivan Vanko has developed the same technology and built weapons of his own in order to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family, in the process, joining forces with Stark's business rival, Justin Hammer. Following the successful release of\" Iron Man\" in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July of that same year, Theroux was hired to write the script, and Favreau was signed to return and direct. Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from\" Iron Man\", while Cheadle was brought in to replace Terrence Howard in the role of James Rhodes. In the early months of 2009, Rourke, Rockwell, and Johansson filled out the supporting cast, and filming took place from April to July of that year. Like its predecessor, the film was shot mostly in California, except for a key sequence in Monaco. \" Iron Man 2\" premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, 2010. The film received generally positive reviews, with praise for Downey's performance as well as for the action sequences, musical score and visual effects. However, the film received criticism for its villain and pacing, with many critics deeming the film inferior to the original. The film was commercially successful, grossing over$ 623.9 million at the worldwide box office, making it the seventh- highest- grossing film of 2010, and receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. The third and final installment of the\" Iron Man\" series,\" Iron Man 3\", was released on May 3, 2013.\"",

Throughout April and May 2012, the film's supporting cast was filled out, with Kingsley, Pearce, and Hall brought in to portray key roles.

Atang de la Rama was born in Pandacan, Manila on January 11, 1902. By the age of 7, she was already starring in Spanish \"zarzuelas\" such as \"MascotaSue\u00f1o de un Vals\", and \"Marina\". At the age of 15, she starred in the sarsuela \"Dalagang Bukid\", where she became known for singing the song, \"Nabasag na Banga\". During the American occupation of the Philippines, Atang de la Rama fought for the dominance of the \"kundiman\", an important Philippine folk song, and the \"sarsuela\", which is a musical play that focused on contemporary Filipino issues such as usury, cockfighting, and colonial mentality. Generations of Filipino artists and audiences consider Atang de la Rama's vocal and acting talents as responsible for much of the success of original Filipino sarsuelas like \"Dalagang Bukid\", and dramas like \"Veronidia\". She has also been a theatrical producer, writer and talent manager. She was the producer and the writer of plays such as \"Anak ni Eva\" and \"Bulaklak ng Kabundukan\". For her achievements and contributions to the art form, she was hailed Queen of the Kundiman and of the Sarsuela in 1979, at the age of 74. Atang believed that art should be for everyone; not only did she perform in major Manila theaters such as the \"Teatro Libertad\" and the \"Teatro Zorilla\", but also in cockpits and open plazas in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. She also made an effort to bring the kundiman and sarsuela to the indigenous peoples of the Philippine such as the Igorots, the Aetas, and the Mangyans. She was also at the forefront of introducing Filipino culture to foreign audiences. At the height of her career, she sang kundimans and other Filipino songs in concerts in such cities as Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo. On May 8, 1987, \"for her sincere devotion to original Filipino theater and music, her outstanding artistry as singer, and as sarsuela actress-playwright-producer, her tireless efforts to bring her art to all sectors of Filipino society and to the world,\" President Corazon C. Aquino proclaimed Atang de la Rama a National Artist of the Philippines for Theater and Music. Atang de la Rama died on July 11, 1991. She was married to National Artist for Literature, Amado V. Hernandez.\"",

Friend and patron of living artists and collectors, he was the son of a picture dealer and the brother-in-law of Sir Joseph Duveen. His witty and acerbic journal, kept for twenty-one years and published posthumously as \"Journal d'un collectionneur: marchand de tableaux\" (1963, revised edition 2011), with a preface by Jean Gu\u00e9henno of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, was translated and published in English as \"Diary of an Art Dealer\" (1966), and is a primary source for the history of modern art and of collecting between the World Wars. Trained in the classic traditions of connoisseurship, a great admirer of Chardin and in general the works of the French eighteenth century, Gimpel had an instinctive sympathy for the modern contemporaries among whom he moved: Georges Braque, Mary Cassatt, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and above all, his intimate friend Marie Laurencin. A friend of Marcel Proust, whom he met at Cabourg in 1907, he had a selective high regard for many museum professionals but a loathing of the experts who provided attributions and certificates of authenticity for paintings in the market. In 1902 his father, Ernest Gimpel, opened E. Gimpel & Wildenstein in New York; the firm would continue in partnership until 1919. In 1905 Ernest and Nathan Wildenstein began negotiating to buy a selection of the magnificent Paris collection of Rodolphe Kann from Kann's estate; however, the powerful firm of Duveen Bros muscled in and bought out their interest, eventually acquiring the entire collection in 1906 for 21 million francs (or over $US4 million), including what were considered in those days twelve Rembrandts. While breaking up the Kann collection and selling it on was a protracted process for the Duveens, E. Gimpel & Wildenstein (Paris and New York) benefited. Ren\u00e9 Gimpel's repeated trips to the United States from 1902 resulted in significant sales to wealthy North American collectors, some of whom he skewered in his private diaries as showing off their artworks \"like rich children showing off their toys\". In May 1919, three weeks of concentrated trading on behalf of E. Gimpel & Wildenstein resulted in sales of five paintings, including Rembrandt's \"Portrait of Titus\" to Jules Bache (now Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, as \"Man in a Red Cloak\", style of Rembrandt), a tapestry \"Saint Veronica\" to Mrs Florence Blumenthal (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and a Houdon portrait bust to C. Ledyard Blair, \"Armand-Thomas Hue, Marquis de Miromesnil\", Frick Collection, New York for $730,000. During World War II Gimpel was interned by the Vichy authorities for his activities in the Resistance, released in 1942, but then re-arrested. In confinement he taught English to his fellow prisoners, in preparation, he said, for their coming liberation. He was sent to Neuengamme concentration camp, near Hamburg, Germany, where his health gave out under the strenuous conditions under which he was held.\"",

A member of the RSDLP from 1904. At first a Menshevik, he joined the Bolsheviks in May 1917. In October 1917, he was member of the Revolutionary Military Council; then served as secretary of the Soviet delegation at the Brest-Litovsk peace talks together with Leon Trotsky and Adolph Joffe. In 1918-1920 and 1927\u20131934, he was the Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. In 1919, he issued a statement concerning relations with China called the Karakhan Manifesto. In 1921, he was the Soviet Ambassador to Poland; in 1923-1926, the Ambassador to China; after 1934, the Ambassador to Turkey. Karakhan was known for his dandyish appearance; Karl Radek is quoted as having \"maliciously described\" him as \"the Ass of Classical Beauty\", while a junior colleague, Alexander Barmine, wrote that \"Our young staff gave him unstinted admiration, amazed that humanity could produce such perfection. He had a purity of profile such as is seen, as a rule, only on ancient coins. \" The British diplomat Robert Bruce Lockhart, who met Karakhan in 1918, described him as: Karakhan was arrested and executed in 1937 during the Great Purge. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956. His third wife (the civil marriage), Marina Semyonova, died in 2010.\"",

The film begins by describing the difficulties the civilian population posed during the Battle of Saipan including the famous mass suicide of Japanese who believed the US would torture them. As the Marianas campaign progressed though, the Marines learned to use the Intelligence Division( ID) to handle the Japanese civilians, and by the time the Marines reached Okinawa, the ID had become a routine part of the operation. The Marianas and Okinawa, pre-war Japanese possessions, had large Japanese civilian populations at the time of their occupation, whereas other islands, like Tarawa, Guam or Iwo Jima, were either uninhabited by civilians, or only by indigenous civilians. The ID used a variety of techniques to handle the Japanese civilians: they first made loudspeaker announcements in Japanese to coax them into surrendering; once a group surrendered they found a community leader or someone in a position of authority to make more loudspeaker broadcasts to encourage further surrenders. Camps are set up, and made self- sufficient as much as possible. Later, other roles of the civilians are explored, especially the use of captured documents and the need to find out who had been a collaborator with the militarist regime.\"",

Its premise is similar to the fourth film in the original series,\" Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\"( 1972), but it is not a direct remake of that film. In the film, a substance designed to help the brain repair itself gives advanced intelligence to a chimpanzee named Caesar, who leads an ape uprising. \" Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" was released on August 5, 2011, to critical and commercial success. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. It was also nominated for five Saturn Awards including Best Director for Wyatt and Best Writing for Jaffa and Silver, winning Best Science Fiction Film, Best Supporting Actor for Serkis and Best Special Effects. Serkis's performance as Caesar was widely acclaimed, earning him many nominations from associations which do not usually recognize performance capture as traditional acting.

Friend and patron of living artists and collectors, he was the son of a picture dealer and the brother-in-law of Sir Joseph Duveen. His witty and acerbic journal, kept for twenty-one years and published posthumously as \"Journal d'un collectionneur: marchand de tableaux\" (1963, revised edition 2011), with a preface by Jean Gu\u00e9henno of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, was translated and published in English as \"Diary of an Art Dealer\" (1966), and is a primary source for the history of modern art and of collecting between the World Wars. Trained in the classic traditions of connoisseurship, a great admirer of Chardin and in general the works of the French eighteenth century, Gimpel had an instinctive sympathy for the modern contemporaries among whom he moved: Georges Braque, Mary Cassatt, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and above all, his intimate friend Marie Laurencin. A friend of Marcel Proust, whom he met at Cabourg in 1907, he had a selective high regard for many museum professionals but a loathing of the experts who provided attributions and certificates of authenticity for paintings in the market. In 1902 his father, Ernest Gimpel, opened E. Gimpel & Wildenstein in New York; the firm would continue in partnership until 1919. In 1905 Ernest and Nathan Wildenstein began negotiating to buy a selection of the magnificent Paris collection of Rodolphe Kann from Kann's estate; however, the powerful firm of Duveen Bros muscled in and bought out their interest, eventually acquiring the entire collection in 1906 for 21 million francs (or over $US4 million), including what were considered in those days twelve Rembrandts. While breaking up the Kann collection and selling it on was a protracted process for the Duveens, E. Gimpel & Wildenstein (Paris and New York) benefited. Ren\u00e9 Gimpel's repeated trips to the United States from 1902 resulted in significant sales to wealthy North American collectors, some of whom he skewered in his private diaries as showing off their artworks \"like rich children showing off their toys\". In May 1919, three weeks of concentrated trading on behalf of E. Gimpel & Wildenstein resulted in sales of five paintings, including Rembrandt's \"Portrait of Titus\" to Jules Bache (now Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, as \"Man in a Red Cloak\", style of Rembrandt), a tapestry \"Saint Veronica\" to Mrs Florence Blumenthal (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and a Houdon portrait bust to C. Ledyard Blair, \"Armand-Thomas Hue, Marquis de Miromesnil\", Frick Collection, New York for $730,000. During World War II Gimpel was interned by the Vichy authorities for his activities in the Resistance, released in 1942, but then re-arrested. In confinement he taught English to his fellow prisoners, in preparation, he said, for their coming liberation. He was sent to Neuengamme concentration camp, near Hamburg, Germany, where his health gave out under the strenuous conditions under which he was held.\"",

He directed and wrote over films between 1931 and 1951 even composing the musical scores for several. He was a pioneer of Variety Theatre, and one of the few tango lyrical writers that has reached timeless classical success. When he was a teenager, he began his journalist job in the Magacine Fray Mochoy, and in the newspapers Cr\u00edtica y \u00daltima Hora. His first play, \"Teatro breve\" is from 1919 with the collaboration of Ivo Pelay. He wrote 180 more. In 1922 the most famous, \"El bailar\u00edn del cabaret\", was staged with the C\u00e9sar Ratti's company, where Corsini triunf\u00f3 (had a success) with \"Patotero sentimental\". In 1923 he travelled to Europe with Luis Bay\u00f3n Herrera. In Paris, where he acted on several plays, he met Carlos Gardel and the idea of filmmaking was born. He wrote the plot and songs for \"Luces de Buenos Aires\", directed by the Chilean Adelqui Millar. It starred Gloria Guzm\u00e1n, Sof\u00eda Boz\u00e1n, Pedro Quartucci and the Julio De Caro musical group. He returned to Buenos Aires, where he introduced the new ideas taken from music hall and varieties shows. He started to work at the Lumit\u00f3n cinema company, with Enrique Tel\u00e9maco Susini . With that film company, released in February 1935, \"Noches de Buenos Aires\", written and directed by Romero, his cinema career began. The film starred Tita Merello, Irma C\u00f3rdoba, Enrique Serrano and Fernando Ochoa. He filmed very quickly, he only wanted to finish and achieve a good result. His films were rejected by critics and intellectuals as a result, but ordinary people liked his style because they knew him from radio of variety shows. He directed films such as Adi\u00f3s pampa m\u00eda in 1946.\"",

He served as vicar general of the Duchy of Athens from 1317 to 1330. He was first proclaimed vicar general by his father in 1317 and sent off to govern Athens on behalf of his younger half-brother Manfred. He arrived in Piraeus with ten galleys later that year, but Manfred had died and was succeeded by another brother, William II. In the year of his arrival, Fadrique married Marulla, the daughter of Boniface of Verona, thus allying himself with the chief lord of Euboea. By this marriage, also, he acquired rights to the castles of Larmena, Karystos, Zetouni, and Gardiki. Over the next two years, Fadrique warred with the Republic of Venice and stormed the city of Negroponte with Turks after Boniface of Verona died. In 1318, John II Ducas, the \"sebastokrator\" of Neopatras, died and Fadrique invaded Thessaly. He took possession of his castles at Zetouni and Gardiki and conquered Neopatras, Siderokastron, Loidoriki, Domokos, and Pharsalus. He conquered the palace of the Ducae at Neopatras and took the title of Vicar General of the Duchy of Neopatras. He built a tower at Neopatras. In 1330, Alfonso was relieved of his duties as vicar general and replaced by Odo de Novelles. He was compensated with the Sicilian counties of Malta and Gozo. He died in 1338 and left five sons, Peter; James, father of Louis Fadrique; William, lord of Livadeia; Boniface, lord of Aigina, Piada and Karystos; John, lord of Salamina and two daughters, Simona, who wed George II Ghisi and Jua.\"",

Juan Carlos is the grandson of Alfonso XIII, the last king of Spain before the abolition of the monarchy in 1931 and the subsequent declaration of the Second Spanish Republic. Juan Carlos was born in Rome, Italy, during his family's exile. \" General\u00edsimo\" Francisco Franco took over the government of Spain after his victory in the Spanish Civil War in 1939, yet in 1947 Spain's status as a monarchy was affirmed and a law was passed allowing Franco to choose his successor. Juan Carlos's father, Juan, was the third son of King Alfonso, who had renounced his claims to the throne in January 1941. Juan was seen by Franco to be too liberal and in 1969 was bypassed in favour of Juan Carlos as Franco's successor as head of state. Juan Carlos spent his early years in Italy and came to Spain in 1947 to continue his studies. After completing his secondary education in 1955, he began his military training and entered the General Military Academy at Zaragoza. Later, he attended the Naval Military School, the General Academy of the Air, and finished his tertiary education at the University of Madrid. In 1962, Juan Carlos married Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark in Athens. The couple had two daughters and a son together: Elena, Cristina, and Felipe. Due to Franco's declining health, Juan Carlos first began periodically acting as Spain's head of state in the summer of 1974. Franco died in November the following year and Juan Carlos became king on 22 November 1975, two days after Franco's death, the first reigning monarch since 1931; although his exiled father did not formally renounce his claims to the throne in favor of his son until 1977. Expected to continue Franco's legacy, Juan Carlos, however, soon after his accession introduced reforms to dismantle the Francoist regime and begin the Spanish transition to democracy. This led to the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 in a referendum, which re-established a constitutional monarchy. In 1981, Juan Carlos played a major role in preventing a coup that attempted to revert Spain to Francoist government in the King's name. In 2008, he was considered the most popular leader in all Ibero- America. Hailed for his role in Spain's transition to democracy, the King and the monarchy's reputation began to suffer after controversies surrounding his family arose, exacerbated by an elephant- hunting trip he undertook during a time of financial crisis in Spain. In 2014, Juan Carlos, citing personal reasons, abdicated in favour of his son, who acceded to the throne as Felipe VI.\"",

The screenplay was adapted by Hodges from Ted Lewis's 1970 novel\" Jack's Return Home\". Producer Michael Klinger optioned the book and made a deal for the ailing Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer( MGM) studio to finance and release the film, bringing in Hodges and Caine. Caine became a co-producer of the film. \" Get Carter\" was Hodges's first feature film as director, as well as being the screen debut of Alun Armstrong. MGM was reducing its European operations and the film became the last project approved before it closed its Borehamwood studios. The film is set in north- east England and was filmed in and around Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and County Durham. The story follows a London gangster, the eponymous Jack Carter( Caine), who travels back to his home town to discover more about his brother Frank's supposedly accidental death. Suspecting foul play, he investigates and interrogates, regaining a feel for the city and its hardened- criminal element; with vengeance on his mind, the situation builds to a violent conclusion. Caine and Hodges had ambitions to produce a more gritty and realistic portrayal of violence and criminal behaviour than had previously been seen in a British film. Caine incorporated his knowledge of real criminal acquaintances into his characterisation of Carter. Hodges and cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky drew heavily on their backgrounds in documentary film. Combined with Hodges' research into the contemporary criminal underworld of Newcastle( in particular the one- armed bandit murder) and the use of hundreds of local bystanders as extras, produced a naturalistic feel in many scenes. The shoot was incident- free and progressed speedily, despite a one- day strike by the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians. The production went from novel to finished film in eight months, with location shooting lasting 40 days. \" Get Carter\" suffered in its promotion, firstly from MGM's problems and secondly owing to the declining British film industry of the period, which relied increasingly on US investment. Initial UK critical reaction to the film was mixed, with British reviewers grudgingly appreciative of the film's technical excellence but dismayed by the complex plot, violence and amorality, in particular Carter's apparent lack of remorse at his actions. Despite this the film did good business in the UK and produced a respectable profit. US critics were generally more enthusiastic and praised the film but it was poorly promoted in the US by United Artists and languished on the drive in circuit while MGM focused its resources on producing a blaxploitation version of the same novel,\" Hit Man\". On its release\" Get Carter\" received no awards and did not seem likely to be well remembered. It was not available on home media until 1993 but always maintained a cult following. Endorsements from a new generation of directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie led to a critical reappraisal which saw it recognized as one of the best British movies. In 1999,\" Get Carter\" was ranked 16th on the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century; five years later, a survey of British film critics in\" Total Film\" magazine chose it as the greatest British film. \" Get Carter\" was remade in 2000 by Warner Bros. under the same title, with Sylvester Stallone starring as Jack Carter, with Caine in a supporting role. This remake was not well received by critics in the US and was not given a UK theatrical release.\"",

Vera was a supporter of federalism, against the idea of a centralized government. After the proclamation of the first national government junta, in 1810, Santa Fe was ruled by lieutenant governors sent from the capital Buenos Aires, which did not sit well with many local citizens and worked to increase the influence of the federalist leader Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, based on the Eastern Bank (today's Uruguay). The Supreme Directorship invaded Santa Fe in March 1815; the next month Artigas liberated it and set up Francisco Antonio Candioti as governor. Candioti was in turn ousted and replaced by the centralist Juan Francisco Tarragona. Vera and other political leaders, notably Estanislao L\u00f3pez, gathered the support of Candioti's followers, and rebelled in March 1816, helped by Artigas's troops coming via Paran\u00e1, Entre R\u00edos. Buenos Aires's occupation forces under Juan Jos\u00e9 Viamonte were defeated, and Mariano Vera was elected governor of Santa Fe. Soon afterwards, the governments of Santa Fe and Buenos Aires signed treaties by which Buenos Aires acknowledged Santa Fe as a \"free and independent\" entity until a national constitution was drawn by the upcoming Congress of Tucum\u00e1n. Santa Fe would send a deputy to the Congress, and the economically essential roads passing through Santa Fe towards Peru and Chile would not be closed to traffic. Governor Vera thus adopted a pragmatical equilibrium stance between Artigas and Buenos Aires, prioritizing the interests of the province rather than ideological concerns. Santa Fe, an agricultural region beside the Paran\u00e1 River, needed to have access to the port of Buenos Aires and at the same time could not allow Buenos Aires to centralize power, which would make its port the only one allowed to function (as it happened decades later, during the rule of Juan Manuel de Rosas). However, the government of Buenos Aires delayed the ratification of the treaties, and started a campaign to retake power in Santa Fe, first through a failed military operation in August 1816, and then giving support to Vera's political enemies and to uprisings in Santa Fe and other provinces. Vera turned decidedly to support the cause of Artigas, sending troops, guns and supplies to the Eastern Bank (modern-day Uruguay). The hostilities continued. In March 1818 Buenos Aires sent new military missions to Santa Fe and Entre R\u00edos. Governor Vera, weakened, was eventually ousted by his former ally Estanislao L\u00f3pez, who would prevail over the centralist army and rule the province for twenty years.\"",

When the male line of Blanca's family died out at the death of her uncle, Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, some of the Carlists recognized her as the legitimate heiress to the Spanish throne.\"",

Atang de la Rama was born in Pandacan, Manila on January 11, 1902. By the age of 7, she was already starring in Spanish \"zarzuelas\" such as \"MascotaSue\u00f1o de un Vals\", and \"Marina\". At the age of 15, she starred in the sarsuela \"Dalagang Bukid\", where she became known for singing the song, \"Nabasag na Banga\". During the American occupation of the Philippines, Atang de la Rama fought for the dominance of the \"kundiman\", an important Philippine folk song, and the \"sarsuela\", which is a musical play that focused on contemporary Filipino issues such as usury, cockfighting, and colonial mentality. Generations of Filipino artists and audiences consider Atang de la Rama's vocal and acting talents as responsible for much of the success of original Filipino sarsuelas like \"Dalagang Bukid\", and dramas like \"Veronidia\". She has also been a theatrical producer, writer and talent manager. She was the producer and the writer of plays such as \"Anak ni Eva\" and \"Bulaklak ng Kabundukan\". For her achievements and contributions to the art form, she was hailed Queen of the Kundiman and of the Sarsuela in 1979, at the age of 74. Atang believed that art should be for everyone; not only did she perform in major Manila theaters such as the \"Teatro Libertad\" and the \"Teatro Zorilla\", but also in cockpits and open plazas in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. She also made an effort to bring the kundiman and sarsuela to the indigenous peoples of the Philippine such as the Igorots, the Aetas, and the Mangyans. She was also at the forefront of introducing Filipino culture to foreign audiences. At the height of her career, she sang kundimans and other Filipino songs in concerts in such cities as Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo. On May 8, 1987, \"for her sincere devotion to original Filipino theater and music, her outstanding artistry as singer, and as sarsuela actress-playwright-producer, her tireless efforts to bring her art to all sectors of Filipino society and to the world,\" President Corazon C. Aquino proclaimed Atang de la Rama a National Artist of the Philippines for Theater and Music. Atang de la Rama died on July 11, 1991. She was married to National Artist for Literature, Amado V. Hernandez.\"",

He was the fourth (but second surviving) and youngest son of Johann Frederick II, Duke of Saxony and Countess Palatine Elisabeth of Simmern-Sponheim. His grandfather, Johann Frederick I, had still held the title of Elector of Saxony, but after the Battle of M\u00fchlberg he lost the title to his cousin Maurice, from the Albertine line. His father tried since then to regain the Electorate again for the Ernestine line. For this purpose he accepted an outlawed knight, Wilhelm von Grumbach, with himself, which led finally to the fact that also over his father the anger of the Emperor. Only one year after his birth was besieged the castle of his father in Gotha by troops of the Elector Augustus of Saxony and finally conquered. His father came into imperial prison from the rest of his life. His mother, Johann Ernst and his older brothers had to flee from Gotha. They found first admission with his uncle, the duke Johann Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar, who took over also the guardianship for the princes -at the same time, he was granted by the Emperor with the lands of his brother Johann Frederick II-. After a short time in Weimar, Johann Ernst, as well as his mother and his brothers, lived in Eisenach and Eisenberg. Later, his uncle Johann Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar lost the Imperial favour. In the Diet of Speyer (1570), the Emperor decided to restore to the three sons of Johann Frederick II his hereditary rights. In 1572 his older brother Frederick Heinrich died from typhus fever. The same year, by the Division of Erfurt, the decision of the Diet of Speyer was made: The lands of his father were extracted again from the duchy of Saxe-Weimar, and created from them the new \"Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach\". Johann Ernst and his older surviving brother, Johann Casimir, were made rulers of the new country. During there minority, the lands were under the guardianship of the three Elector Princes: Frederick III of the Palatinate (also his maternal grandfather), Johann George of Brandenburg and Augustus of Saxony; also, they took the regency over Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. The duchess Elizabeth moved to Austria, where she should live themselves in the future in the proximity of her husband, still imperial prissioner. The two young princes, Johann Casimir and Johann Ernst, moved to Coburg, the future residence of his new principality. With only six years, Johann Ernst was separated from his parents forever and entrusted to the education of strange persons. Since 1578 he visited the University of Leipzig then together with his brother. In 1586, after the wedding of his brother with Anna of Saxony, the daughter of the Elector Augustus, the guardianship finalized, and Johann Casimir began, together with his brother, the independent ruling of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. Johann Casimir and Johann Ernst governed together the principality for the next ten years; however, Johann Casimir carried the main responsibility for the government as an older brother. Also, in order to had a separated residence from his brother too, Johann Ernst establishes himself in the small town of Marksuhl on 1587. Since 1590 Johann Ernst withdrew himself from the government of the duchy, with his brother completely agreed it, that this should govern the duchy for five years alone, when this time had elapsed and finally agreed (in 1596) with its brother to a new divisionary treaty. The duchy of Saxe-Eisenach was taken by Johann Ernst as independent principality separated from Saxe-Coburg, who remained with Johann Casimir. Thus, Saxe-Eisenach, for the first time in his history, had his own independent political unit became within the Holy Roman Empire. During his first year of reign, Johann Ernst still live in Marsuhl because Eisenach, the new capital of his country, was inhabited and, only with the establishment of his official residence the citizens began to moved there. In 1598 Johann Ernst created for his duchy his own \"Landesregierung\" (Federal State Government) and a\" Konsistorium\". In 1633 his brother, the duke Johann Casimir of Saxe-Coburg, died childless. For this, Johann Ernst inherited Saxe-Coburg, and until his own death he governed both countries in a personal union, but maintains, however, his residence in Eisenach. In Wiener Neustadt on 23 November 1591 Johann Ernst married firstly with Elisabeth of Mansfeld-Hinterort. She died four days after giving birth to their only son: In Rotenburg on 14 May 1598 Johann Ernst married secondly with Christine of Hesse-Kassel. The marriage was happy, but remained childless. With the death of Johann Ernst ended the older line of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. His principality was divided (under the rules of the Ernestine line) between Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Altenburg.\"",

According to an interview on Mediocre Poker Radio, Booth was a victim of the Ultimate Bet cheating scandal, and may have been cheated out of$ 2 million. He continued to play poker online after being cheated, but without his former success. Since 2008, he has lost$ 4.2 million playing poker. Booth appeared on the second season of NBC's\" Poker After Dark\" on the episode\" International Week\" and finished in second place to Patrik Antonius.

In November 2009, Booth left Full Tilt Poker to become the Spokesman and Director of Poker Programming at GR88.com.

Atang de la Rama was born in Pandacan, Manila on January 11, 1902. By the age of 7, she was already starring in Spanish \"zarzuelas\" such as \"MascotaSue\u00f1o de un Vals\", and \"Marina\". At the age of 15, she starred in the sarsuela \"Dalagang Bukid\", where she became known for singing the song, \"Nabasag na Banga\". During the American occupation of the Philippines, Atang de la Rama fought for the dominance of the \"kundiman\", an important Philippine folk song, and the \"sarsuela\", which is a musical play that focused on contemporary Filipino issues such as usury, cockfighting, and colonial mentality. Generations of Filipino artists and audiences consider Atang de la Rama's vocal and acting talents as responsible for much of the success of original Filipino sarsuelas like \"Dalagang Bukid\", and dramas like \"Veronidia\". She has also been a theatrical producer, writer and talent manager. She was the producer and the writer of plays such as \"Anak ni Eva\" and \"Bulaklak ng Kabundukan\". For her achievements and contributions to the art form, she was hailed Queen of the Kundiman and of the Sarsuela in 1979, at the age of 74. Atang believed that art should be for everyone; not only did she perform in major Manila theaters such as the \"Teatro Libertad\" and the \"Teatro Zorilla\", but also in cockpits and open plazas in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. She also made an effort to bring the kundiman and sarsuela to the indigenous peoples of the Philippine such as the Igorots, the Aetas, and the Mangyans. She was also at the forefront of introducing Filipino culture to foreign audiences. At the height of her career, she sang kundimans and other Filipino songs in concerts in such cities as Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo. On May 8, 1987, \"for her sincere devotion to original Filipino theater and music, her outstanding artistry as singer, and as sarsuela actress-playwright-producer, her tireless efforts to bring her art to all sectors of Filipino society and to the world,\" President Corazon C. Aquino proclaimed Atang de la Rama a National Artist of the Philippines for Theater and Music. Atang de la Rama died on July 11, 1991. She was married to National Artist for Literature, Amado V. Hernandez.\"",

                "page_content": "\"Johann Christoph Bach\tJohann Christoph Bach (baptised \u2013 31 March 1703) was a German composer and organist of the Baroque period. He was born at Arnstadt, the son of Heinrich Bach, Johann Sebastian Bach's first cousin once removed and the first cousin of J.S. Bach's father, Johann Ambrosius Bach. He was also the uncle of Maria Barbara Bach, J. S. Bach's first wife and second cousin. Johann Christoph married Maria Elisabeth Wiedemann in 1667. They had seven children, including four sons who became musicians: Johann Nicolaus (10 October 1669 \u2013 4 November 1753), Johann Christoph Jr. (29 August 1676 \u2013 1738), Johann Friedrich (1682\u20131730), and Johann Michael (1685\u2013unknown). Two of their grandsons later sailed to America and founded the Bach family there: Johann Heinrich Bach (1709\u20131789) and Johann Wilhelm Bach (1722\u20131794). He is not to be confused with Johann Sebastian Bach's son, Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach. Johann Christoph had a reputation as a composer that was only equalled by that of Johann Sebastian within the Bach family during his lifetime. He was organist at Eisenach and later a member of the court chamber orchestra there. His brother, Johann Michael Bach (Johann Sebastian Bach's father-in-law and Maria Barbara's father), was also a composer. Some of the works were later attributed to Johann Sebastian, but were recently recognized as written by Johann Christoph. One of the most famous works is the cantata , based on the \"Song of Solomon\". Despite his success as a musician, Johann Christoph experienced financial difficulties, which may have resulted in his not having been selected as the guardian of Johann Sebastian when the latter's parents died. Yet Johann Christoph found the money to have his portrait painted in oil several times, including the well-known portrait of him that is on display in a Berlin museum. Johann Christoph was heavily in debt when he died at Eisenach. He died just ten days after his wife Maria died. Sebastian Bach described him in his Genealogy (1735) as \"the profound composer\", thus hinting at his reputation, not just within the family, but within society.\"",

                "page_content": "\"Johann Sebastian Bach\tJohann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He is known for instrumental compositions such as the \"Art of Fugue\", the \"Brandenburg Concertos\", and the \"Goldberg Variations\", and for vocal music such as the \"St Matthew Passion\" and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach Revival he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Western art musical canon. The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach. After being orphaned at age 10, he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph Bach, after which he continued his musical development in L\u00fcneburg. From 1703 he was back in Thuringia, working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and, for longer stretches of time, at courts in Weimar, where he expanded his organ repertory, and K\u00f6then, where he was mostly engaged with chamber music. From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor (cantor at St. Thomas) in Leipzig. He composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city, and for its university's student ensemble Collegium Musicum. From 1726 he published some of his keyboard music. In Leipzig, as had happened during some of his earlier positions, he had difficult relations with his employer, a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign, Augustus, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, in 1736. In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions. He died of complications after eye surgery in 1750 at the age of 65. Bach enriched established German styles through his mastery of counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include hundreds of cantatas, both sacred and secular. He composed Latin church music, Passions, oratorios, and motets. He often adopted Lutheran hymns, not only in his larger vocal works, but for instance also in his four-part chorales and sacred songs. He wrote extensively for organ and for other keyboard instruments. He composed concertos, for instance for violin and for harpsichord, and suites, as chamber music as well as for orchestra. Many of his works employ contrapuntal genres such as fugue. Throughout the 18th century Bach was mostly renowned as an organist, while his keyboard music, such as \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\", was appreciated for its didactic qualities. The 19th century saw the publication of some major Bach biographies, and by the end of that century all of his known music had been printed. Dissemination of scholarship on the composer continued through periodicals exclusively devoted to him, and publications such as the \"Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis\" (BWV, a numbered catalogue of his works) and new critical editions of his compositions. His music was further popularised through a multitude of arrangements, including the \"Air on the G String\".\"",

He was the fourth (but second surviving) and youngest son of Johann Frederick II, Duke of Saxony and Countess Palatine Elisabeth of Simmern-Sponheim. His grandfather, Johann Frederick I, had still held the title of Elector of Saxony, but after the Battle of M\u00fchlberg he lost the title to his cousin Maurice, from the Albertine line. His father tried since then to regain the Electorate again for the Ernestine line. For this purpose he accepted an outlawed knight, Wilhelm von Grumbach, with himself, which led finally to the fact that also over his father the anger of the Emperor. Only one year after his birth was besieged the castle of his father in Gotha by troops of the Elector Augustus of Saxony and finally conquered. His father came into imperial prison from the rest of his life. His mother, Johann Ernst and his older brothers had to flee from Gotha. They found first admission with his uncle, the duke Johann Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar, who took over also the guardianship for the princes -at the same time, he was granted by the Emperor with the lands of his brother Johann Frederick II-. After a short time in Weimar, Johann Ernst, as well as his mother and his brothers, lived in Eisenach and Eisenberg. Later, his uncle Johann Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar lost the Imperial favour. In the Diet of Speyer (1570), the Emperor decided to restore to the three sons of Johann Frederick II his hereditary rights. In 1572 his older brother Frederick Heinrich died from typhus fever. The same year, by the Division of Erfurt, the decision of the Diet of Speyer was made: The lands of his father were extracted again from the duchy of Saxe-Weimar, and created from them the new \"Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach\". Johann Ernst and his older surviving brother, Johann Casimir, were made rulers of the new country. During there minority, the lands were under the guardianship of the three Elector Princes: Frederick III of the Palatinate (also his maternal grandfather), Johann George of Brandenburg and Augustus of Saxony; also, they took the regency over Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. The duchess Elizabeth moved to Austria, where she should live themselves in the future in the proximity of her husband, still imperial prissioner. The two young princes, Johann Casimir and Johann Ernst, moved to Coburg, the future residence of his new principality. With only six years, Johann Ernst was separated from his parents forever and entrusted to the education of strange persons. Since 1578 he visited the University of Leipzig then together with his brother. In 1586, after the wedding of his brother with Anna of Saxony, the daughter of the Elector Augustus, the guardianship finalized, and Johann Casimir began, together with his brother, the independent ruling of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. Johann Casimir and Johann Ernst governed together the principality for the next ten years; however, Johann Casimir carried the main responsibility for the government as an older brother. Also, in order to had a separated residence from his brother too, Johann Ernst establishes himself in the small town of Marksuhl on 1587. Since 1590 Johann Ernst withdrew himself from the government of the duchy, with his brother completely agreed it, that this should govern the duchy for five years alone, when this time had elapsed and finally agreed (in 1596) with its brother to a new divisionary treaty. The duchy of Saxe-Eisenach was taken by Johann Ernst as independent principality separated from Saxe-Coburg, who remained with Johann Casimir. Thus, Saxe-Eisenach, for the first time in his history, had his own independent political unit became within the Holy Roman Empire. During his first year of reign, Johann Ernst still live in Marsuhl because Eisenach, the new capital of his country, was inhabited and, only with the establishment of his official residence the citizens began to moved there. In 1598 Johann Ernst created for his duchy his own \"Landesregierung\" (Federal State Government) and a\" Konsistorium\". In 1633 his brother, the duke Johann Casimir of Saxe-Coburg, died childless. For this, Johann Ernst inherited Saxe-Coburg, and until his own death he governed both countries in a personal union, but maintains, however, his residence in Eisenach. In Wiener Neustadt on 23 November 1591 Johann Ernst married firstly with Elisabeth of Mansfeld-Hinterort. She died four days after giving birth to their only son: In Rotenburg on 14 May 1598 Johann Ernst married secondly with Christine of Hesse-Kassel. The marriage was happy, but remained childless. With the death of Johann Ernst ended the older line of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach. His principality was divided (under the rules of the Ernestine line) between Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Altenburg.\"",

During the reign of his uncle Itzcoatl, Tlacaelel was given the office of Tlacochcalcatl, but during the war against the Tepanecs in the late 1420s, he was promoted to first adviser to the ruler, a position called \"Cihuacoatl\" in Nahuatl, an office that Tlacaelel held during the reigns of four consecutive \"Tlatoque\", until his death in 1487. Tlacaelel recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a chosen people, elevated the tribal god/hero Huitzilopochtli to top of the pantheon of gods, and increased militarism. In tandem with this, Tlacaelel is said to have increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Diego Dur\u00e1n). Dur\u00e1n also states that it was during the reign of Moctezuma I, as an invention of Tlacaelel that the flower wars, in which the Aztecs fought Tlaxcala and other Nahuan city-states, were instigated. To strengthen the Aztec nobility, he helped create and enforce sumptuary laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks. He also instigated a policy of burning the books of conquered peoples with the aim of erasing all memories of a pre-Aztec past. When he dedicated the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan, Tlacaelel had brought his nation to the height of its power. The dedication took place in 1484 and was celebrated with the sacrifice of many war captives. After Tlacaelel's death in 1487, the Mexica Empire continued to expand north into the Gran Chichimeca and south toward the Maya lands.\"",

He began singing as a child and joined the Soul Stirrers before moving to a solo career where he scored a string of hit songs like \"You Send MeA Change Is Gonna ComeWonderful WorldChain GangTwistin' the Night Away\", and \"Bring It On Home to Me\". His pioneering contributions to soul music contributed to the rise of Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Billy Preston, and popularized the likes of Otis Redding and James Brown. AllMusic biographer Bruce Eder wrote that Cooke was \"the inventor of soul music\", and possessed \"an incredible natural singing voice and a smooth, effortless delivery that has never been surpassed\". On December 11, 1964, at the age of 33, Cooke was shot and killed by Bertha Franklin, the manager of the Hacienda Motel in Los Angeles, California. After an inquest, the courts ruled Cooke's death to be a justifiable homicide. Since that time, the circumstances of his death have been called into question by Cooke's family.\"",

He was involved in the chaos that surrounded the succession to Sultan Bayezid II (1481\u20131512). Murad's father, Ahmet, the legal heir to the Ottoman throne, had fought against \u015eehzade Selim (later Selim I); during this struggle, Ahmet received support from King (\"Shah\") Ismail I (1501\u20131524) of the neighboring Safavid Empire. When Ahmet was put to death by the victorious Selim, Prince Murad was subsequently given support by Ismail I as claimant to the throne. Ismail I wanted to use prince Murad to mobilize opposition against Selim I. In 1512, during Nur-Ali Khalifa's large-scale campaign in Anatolia, Murad joined his campaign, and even \"girded the Qizilbash crown\". According to information Selim I received from his spies (December 1512/January 1513), Ismail I allegedly wanted to conquer Anatolia, give the Rum beylerbeylik to Murad, while the rest of the territory would be ruled by the Qizilbash. Anyhow, when the Safavid support meant for Murad failed to materialize, the scheme was abandoned, and Murad migrated to the Safavid Empire where he was given asylum. He died at Kashan, or Isfahan. Ismail I's support to these rivals of Selim I formed one of the main \"casus belli\" that led to the decisive Battle of Chaldiran (1514).\"",

Gershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark, Henry Cowell, and Joseph Brody. He began his career as a song plugger but soon started composing Broadway theater works with his brother Ira Gershwin and with Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris intending to study with Nadia Boulanger, but she refused him. He subsequently composed \"An American in Paris\", returned to New York City and wrote \"Porgy and Bess\" with Ira and DuBose Heyward. Initially a commercial failure , it came to be considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century and an American cultural classic.

Appointed Acting Lieutenant 21 December 1812 and Lieutenant 24 July 1813, Hamilton served with distinction throughout the War of 1812, only to be killed shortly after the Treaty of Ghent had formally ended the war.

He was the eldest son of Thomas II of Savoy and Beatrice di Fieschi, niece of Pope Innocent IV. Upon the death of his father, Thomas became Count in his paternal estates in Piedmont. When his first cousin Boniface, Count of Savoy died in 1263, the 15-year-old Thomas regarded himself as the successor of the deceased, and claimed the county and the headship of the house. However, his late father's younger brother Peter II, Count of Savoy, a sonless nobleman who had resided in England for much of his life, was recognized as count. After Peter's death in 1268, Thomas continued his claim although Philip of Savoy, archbishop of Lyon, the youngest surviving brother of his father and also sonless, succeeded in the county and was recognized. Thomas III, as he was the eldest son and heir of Thomas II, felt an injustice in being surpassed by younger brothers of his father, and claimed unsuccessfully Savoy from his uncles. Thomas III married in 1274 to Guia of Burgundy, the stepdaughter of his uncle Philip I of Savoy and they had five children: Philip and Thomas were in dispute much of their reigns 1268\u201382. Thomas' marriage was a rather unsuccessful attempt to patch up things and get Philip to recognize hims as the successor in Savoy, which would have belonged to Thomas, him being the eldest son of Thomas II and thus the founder of the genealogically senior line of the House of Savoy. Philip\u2019s will charged his niece Eleanor of Provence and her son King Edward I of England with the inheritance of Savoy.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\"",

Premiering in New York City on June 30, 2010, it opened the following day in the rest of the US grossing an estimated$ 16 million.

However, James Newton Howard's score received critical acclaim. The film swept the parody Golden Raspberry Awards in 2010, with five\" wins\" including Worst Picture. It is sometimes considered one of the worst movies ever made. \" The Last Airbender\" opened in second place at the box office behind.

She was married firstly to British consular agent Beauchamp Caulfield-Stoker, then to the pre-communist Chinese statesman Wellington Koo, and was a daughter and heiress of the colonial Indonesian tycoon Oei Tiong Ham, Majoor der Chinezen. Both the parents of Oei Hui-lan hailed from the establishment: her father stemmed from one of the wealthiest families in Java, while her mother came from the 'Cabang Atas' aristocracy as a descendant of a \"Luitenant der Chinezen\" in Semarang's 18th-century Dutch bureaucracy. After an unsuccessful marriage with Caulfield-Stoker, she met Wellington Koo while in Paris in 1920. They married in Brussels the following year and first lived in Geneva in connection with the establishment of the League of Nations. In 1923, she moved with her husband to Beijing where he served as Acting Premier in the evolving republican Chinese state. During his second term (October 1926\u2014June 1927), Wellington Koo also acted as President of the Republic of China for a brief period, making Oei Hui-lan the First Lady of China. The couple then spent time in Shanghai, Paris and London where Oei Hui-lan became a celebrated hostess. In 1941, she moved to New York where she died in 1992.

The exhibition was then taken to London\u2019s Canary Wharf as part of the millennium celebrations in 2000 where her horses caught the attention of Tim Smit KBE founder of the Eden Project and she was invited to become one of their resident artists. Her horse was voted the most popular art work there and has since become widely known as The Eden Horse. By 2001 she was casting works in bronze and had bought a small converted Coach House in fourteen acres of steep woodland with two acres of water-meadow and a stream where she began to explore site specific sculpture and over the next decade created a sculpture garden which in 2008 was included in The National Gardens Scheme's Yellow Book. The house was extended to include a gallery. In 2009 she set up Olchard Press. She published \"Heather Jansch's Diary\". Her sculptures can cost up to \u00a355,000 each and take three years to produce.\"",

Jansch was a leading figure in the 1960s British folk revival, touring folk clubs and recording several solo albums, as well as collaborating with other musicians such as John Renbourn and Anne Briggs. In 1968, he co-founded the band Pentangle, touring and recording with them until their break-up in 1972. He then took a few years' break from music, returning in the late 1970s to work on a series of projects with other musicians. He joined a reformed Pentangle in the early 1980s and remained with them as they evolved through various changes of personnel until 1995. Until his death, Jansch continued to work as a solo artist. Jansch's work influenced artists including Al Stewart, Paul Simon, Johnny Marr, Elton John, Ian Anderson, Bernie Taupin, Bernard Butler, Jimmy Page, Nick Drake, Graham Coxon, Donovan, Neil Young, Hope Sandoval, Fleet Foxes, Devendra Banhart, Neil Halstead, and Roy Harper.

Bahram Beyzaie is the son of the poet Ne'matallah Beyzai (best known by his literary pseudonym \"Zok\u0101'i\"). The celebrated poet Adib Beyzai, known as one of the most profound poets of 20th-century Iran, is Bahram's paternal uncle. Bahram Beyzaie's paternal grandfather, Mirz\u0101 Mohammad-Rez\u0101 \u0100r\u0101ni (\"Ebn Ruh\"), and paternal great-grandfather, the mulla Mohammad-Faqih \u0100r\u0101ni (\"Ruh'ol-Amin\"), were also notable poets. In spite of his somewhat belated start in cinema, Beyzai is often considered a pioneer of a generation of filmmakers whose works are sometimes described as the Iranian New Wave. His \"Bashu, the Little Stranger\" (1986) was voted \"Best Iranian Film of all time\" in November 1999 by a Persian movie magazine \"Picture World\" poll of 150 Iranian critics and professionals. Still, even before the outset of his cinematic career in 1970, he was a leading playwright (as well as theater historian), so much so that he is often considered the greatest playwright of the Persian language, and holds a reputation as \"the Shakespeare of Persia.\" Since 2010, Beyzai has lived and taught at Stanford University, United States.\"",

He was commissioned into the 60th Rifles and was posted to Malta and British India before seeing active service in the European theatre of the First World War, which left him severely wounded. He then took up a posting as assistant adjutant at the Royal Military College. After the war, his main sphere of activity was in East Africa, where he served as Private Secretary to the Governor of Uganda( 1925 \u2013 1927), Chairman of the Agricultural Production and Settlement Board for Kenya( 1939 \u2013 1945), Timber Controller for East Africa( 1940 \u2013 1945), Member of the Government of Kenya for Agriculture and Natural Resources( 1945 \u2013 1955), and Speaker of the Kenya Legislative Council( 1955 \u2013 1960). He was a Delegate to the Delhi Conference of 1940. He became the heir presumptive of his third cousin, William Cavendish- Bentinck, 7th Duke of Portland, after the deaths of the latter's brother Lord( Francis) Morven Dallas Cavendish- Bentinck( 1900- 1950) and half- uncle Charles Cavendish- Bentinck( 1868- 1956). The previous duke's lands came to stay with the descendants of the 7th Duke and never passed to the distantly related 8th Duke in 1977. In the early 20th century the usual\" tail male\" arrangement of the\" entailed\" largest landholdings became deprecated by powerful statutes as it tended to leave noble daughters with little. The 6th Duke, before dying in 1943 broke the entails and set up a trust which saw as his son the future 7th Duke left no son Welbeck Abbey and other large holdings would go to his granddaughters in turn including Lady Anne Cavendish- Bentinck. No viable family court case could ensue as the fee tail was abolished as a recognised entity in the abstract(\" in law\") under the Law of Property Act 1925 and any remote, entailed beneficiaries could be disinherited under the Settled Land Acts. The new Duke of Portland continued to live in Nairobi. Elizabeth II shares an ancestor, in the 3rd Duke of Portland, through her maternal grandmother Cecilia Cavendish- Bentinck, and is thus a third cousin, once removed, of the 8th Duke of Portland.\"",

The film tells the story of a schizophrenic young woman (Andersson) vacationing with her family on a remote island, during which time her author father attempts to use her illness in his work, her brother experiences sexual frustration, and she experiences delusions about meeting God, who appears to her in the form of a monstrous spider. Bergman structured the film as a three-act play, drawing on his personal experiences and relationships. The film was his first of several shot on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6, at the recommendation of cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The score incorporates the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Themes explored include the equation of God with love, exploitation in art, psychosis, and sexuality. \"Through a Glass Darkly\" was released to positive reviews, specifically for Andersson's performance, and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was followed by Bergman's thematically related 1963 films \"Winter Light\" and \"The Silence\".\"",

Lady Rose Paget, as she was before her marriage, was the fourth of five daughters\u2014 her eldest sister Elizabeth and another sister, Caroline, shared the dark good looks of their mother (the former Lady Victoria Manners, eldest daughter of the 8th Duke of Rutland). Her brother was the 7th Marquess of Anglesey. Another of Paget's sisters, Mary, was brain-damaged, and Paget made herself responsible for her sister's welfare until her death in 1996. In her teens, Paget trained as a ballet dancer with Marie Rambert, and under the name Rose Bayly made her debut at Sadler's Wells in Swan Lake in 1937. After being largely educated at home, Paget led an unconventional life, being at different times a ballerina, a florist, a land girl and a countrywoman. Twice engaged to the 8th Duke of Wellington, Paget eventually married Squadron Leader The Hon. John Francis McLaren, the second son of the 2nd Baron Aberconway in 1940. He died in 1953. The McLarens had two daughters, Victoria and Harriet. In her widowhood, McLaren became friends with Muriel Belcher (founder of the club, the Colony Room) and the artist Francis Bacon. At about this time McLaren established her florist's business, which operated from the basement of her house in Chelsea. Along with Pamela Forster (the daughter of Lord Forster of Harraby and a former employee of Constance Spry), they supplied the flowers for the wedding of Princess Margaret to Antony Armstrong Jones in 1960. McLaren left London in 1975 and returned to Wales, retiring to her house on the Bodnant Estate. In later life, McLaren held several prominent positions including County chairwoman of Macmillan Nurses, president of Conwy's Churchill Club and the president of the Eglwysbach Show. McLaren died on 1 November 2005.\"",

His brother Lodewijk van Nassau had the title\" Lord of Beverweerd and Odijk\". From his 19th year on, Willem served in the Dutch army fighting Spain in the Dutch Revolt( 1568 \u2013 1648). Aged only 24 he received the rank of lieutenant- admiral of Holland and West Friesland, replacing stadholder Frederik Hendrik. He led the Dutch ships that participated in the C\u00e1diz expedition of 1625. In the summer of 1627 he was present at the Siege of Grol. On the 18 August, not long before the end of the siege, fighting with the French troops at the front, Willem received a bullet wound which later proved fatal. Thus he died on his 27th birthday, with Lodewijk inheriting Willem's fiefdom. On 4 April 1627, 4 months before his death, Willem married Anna van der Noot, lady of Hoogwoud and Aartswoud, in Sluis. Though he had no children with Anna, he had one illegitimate son by Barbara Augustinus Cocx, Willem Jonker van Nassau( 1620- 1679).\"",

Thanu Pillai\tPattom Thanu Pillai( 15 July 188527 July 1970) was a participant in the Indian independence movement who later served as the Chief Minister of Kerala from 22 February 1960 to 25 September 1962. He was known as the' Bhishmacharya' of Kerala politics. Born in Thiruvananthapuram, A. Thanu Pillai was the son of Varadayyan and Eswari Amma. Thanu Pillai completed his studies and earned a degree in law. He had practised as a lawyer as well. But soon he got attracted towards Indian Freedom Struggle movement and abandoned his career in favour of involvement in the struggle and joined the Indian National Congress. He became the leader of Indian National Congress in the erstwhile princely state of Travancore. Pattom Thanu Pillai remained as one of the leaders of Indian National Congress during the period when Kingdom of Tranvancore became an Independent state and later merged with Cochin to form Travancore- Cochin. On 3 June 1947, United Kingdom accepted demands for a partition and announced its intention to quit India within a short period. The Maharaja of Travancore desired to declare himself independent. Supported by the then Diwan, C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, Chithira Thirunal issued a declaration of independence on 18 June 1947. As Travancore's declaration of independence was unacceptable to India, negotiations were started with the Diwan by the Government of India. Family sources indicate that C. P., himself, was not in favour of independence but only greater autonomy and that a favourable agreement had been reached between C. P. and the Indian representatives by 23 July 1947 and accession to the Indian Union could not be carried out only because it was pending approval by the Raja. Nevertheless, an assassination attempt was made on C. P. on 25 July 1947 during a concert commemorating the anniversary of Swati Thirunal. C. P. survived with multiple stab wounds and hastened the accession of Travancore state to the Indian Union soon after his recovery. After the accession of Travancore state to the Indian Union, P. G. N. Unnithan took over as the last Diwan of independent Travancore on August 20, 1947 following C. P. Ramaswami Iyer resigning as Diwan( subsequent to the attempt on Sir CP's life at the\" Swathi Thirunal Music academy\" on July 25, 1947). P. G. N. Unnithan chaired the Travancore Constitutional Reforms Committee. He relinquished office on March 24, 1948 when a people's government led by Sri Pattom Thanu Pillai as Prime Minister took over. Pattom Thanu Pilla was the first Prime Minister of Independent Travancore state. He resigned as Prime Minister of Tranvacore on 17 October 1948. He was succeeded by Parur T. K. Narayana Pillai as the second and last Prime Minister of Travancore. After India's independence in 1947, Travancore and Cochin were merged to form Travancore- Cochin on 1 July 1949. It was originally called United State of Travancore and Cochin with Trivandrum as the capital. It was renamed State of Travancore- Cochin in January 1950 and was recognised as a state. During merger of Travancore and Cochin E. Ikkanda Warrier was the Prime Minister of the state of Cochin. Warrier resigned as the last Prime Minister of the state of Cochin on 30 June 1949 helping the merger of the two states. Parur T. K. Narayana Pillai was unanimously elected the leader of the Congress Legislature Party and he assumed charge as the first Chief Minister of Travancore- Cochin from 1 July 1949. First Ministry of the state of Travancore- Cochin headed by Parur T. K. Narayana Pillai resigned on 24 February 1951 following a corruption charge on the ministry. He was succeeded by C. Kesavan as the second Chief Minister of Travancore- Cochin. The first assembly of the state of Travancore- Cochin was dissolved on 12 March 1952 following the resignation of C Kesavan. Following the elections to the Legislative Assembly of the held on March 27, 1952 A. J. John became the third Chief Minister of Travancore- Cochin. The second assembly of Travancore- Cochin lasted till 16 March 1954. By that time Pattom Thanu Pillai left Indian National Congress and joined Praja Socialist Party( PSP). In the election for the third Legislative Assembly of Travancore- Cochin held in 1954, Praja Socialist Party won 19 seats out of the contested 38 seats. Praja Socialist Party formed a coalition government along with the Indian National Congress who had won 45 seats. Pattom Thanu Pillai became the fourth Chief Minister of Travancore- Cochin with the support of Indian National Congress on 16 March 1954. He resigned on 10 February 1955 and was succeeded by Panampilly Govinda Menon as the last Chief Minister of Travancore- Cochin. He remained in office till 23 March 1956. After that the state remained under President's rule till 5 April 1957. During this time state of Kerala was formed. Under State Reorganisation Act of 1956, the four southern taluks of Travancore, namely Thovalai, Agasteeswaram, Kalkulam and Vilavancode and a part of the Chencotta Taluk was merged with Madras State. On 1 November 1956 Travancore- Cochin was joined with Malabar District of Madras State, the taluk of Kasaragod and South Kanara to form the new state of Kerala. After the first ever elections to the Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957, the Communist Party of India emerged as the single largest party. E M S Namboodiripad formed the first elected government with the support of 5 independent legislators. The government was not able to complete its full 5 years term. The Communist- led government collapsed as a consequence of the movement known as the\" Vimochana Samaram\"( Liberation Struggle). The Communist government was dismissed on 31 July 1959 and President's rule was imposed in the state, under Article 356 of the constitution. Fresh Elections were held in 1960 and Pattom A. Thanu Pillai became the second Chief Minister of Kerala, as head of a PSP- Congress coalition administration. He assumed office on 22 February 1960. However, he resigned as chief minister of Kerala on 26 September 1962 to make way for R. Sankar of the Indian National Congress as the next Chief Minister of the state.

He was the most prominent sculptor of Croatian modern sculpture and a leading personality of artistic life in Zagreb. He studied at the Pavle Bilini\u0107's Stone Workshop in Split and at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he was formed under the influence of the Secession. He traveled throughout Europe and studied the works of ancient and Renaissance masters, especially Michelangelo, and French sculptors A. Rodin, A. Bourdelle and A. Maillola. He was the initiator of the national-romantic group Meduli\u0107 (he advocated the creation of art of national features inspired by the heroic folk songs). During the First World War, he lived in emigration. After the war, he returned to Croatia and began a long and fruitful period of sculpture and pedagogical work. In 1942 he emigrated to Italy, in 1943 to Switzerland and in 1947 to the United States. He was a professor of sculpture at the Syracuse University and from 1955 at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. Most of his early works of symbolic themes were formed in the spirit of the Secession, some of which, like the Well of Life, show impressionist restless surfaces created under the influence of Rodin's naturalism, and the second, reviving national myth, become stylized monumental plastics (Kosovo cycle, 1908-1910). Before the First World War, he left pathetic epic stylization, expressing increasingly emotional states, as evidenced by the wooden reliefs of biblical themes made in a combination of Archaic, Gothic, Secessionist and Expressionist styles. During the 1920s and 1930s, the classical component prevailed in his works. In this period, he created a number of public monuments of strong plastic expression, pronounced and legible shapes (Grgur Ninski and Marko Maruli\u0107 in Split, Andrija Meduli\u0107, Andrija Ka\u010di\u0107-Mio\u0161i\u0107 and Josip Juraj Strossmayer in Zagreb, \"The Bowman\" and \"The Spearman\" in Chicago). Portraits take a special place in his opus. Me\u0161trovi\u0107 achieved works of strong plastic value in the construction-sculptural monuments and projects, mostly with central layout (the Mausoleum of the Ra\u010di\u0107 family in Cavtat, the Mausoleum of the Me\u0161trovi\u0107 family in Otavice, the Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Pavilion in Zagreb, Monument to the Unknown Hero in Belgrade). He also designed a memorial church of King Zvonimir in Biskupija near Knin inspired by old Croatian churches, a representative family palace, today the Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Gallery, and reconstructed renaissance fortified mansion Crikvine-Ka\u0161tilac in Split.\"",

He was born in Na\u0161ice as the eldest son of Ladislav Peja\u010devi\u0107, a Ban of Croatia (1880\u20131883).

At the beginning of the 20th century, he was faced with a new direction of Croatian policy marked by political alliance between Croats and Serbs in Austria-Hungary for mutual benefit. A Croat-Serb Coalition was formed in 1905 and it governed the Croatian lands from 1906 until the dissolution of the Dual Monarchy in 1918. As Peja\u010devi\u0107 supported the ruling Coalition in its resistance towards the Hungarian quest in 1907 to introduce the Hungarian language to be the official language on railways in Croatia, he was forced to resign. He also took part as the Minister for Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia in the Hungarian Government from 1913 to 1916. However during World War I he was interned in France on 22 August 1914. After that he was substituted by the Prime Minister Istv\u00e1n Tisza. Peja\u010devi\u0107 died in Vienna. Among his children, the best known is his daughter Dora, a Croatian composer.

He was the only son of Louis, Prince of Piacenza, and his wife Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain. Born at the Royal Palace of Madrid at the court of his maternal grandfather King Charles IV of Spain, he spent his first years living at the Spanish court. In 1801, by the Treaty of Aranjuez, Charles became Crown Prince of Etruria, a newly created kingdom formed from territories of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Charles moved to Italy with his parents and in 1803, not yet four years old, he succeeded his father as King of Etruria under the name Charles Louis I. His mother Infanta Maria Luisa assumed the regency while Charles Louis' minority lasted. In 1807 Napoleon Bonaparte dissolved the kingdom of Etruria and Charles Louis and his mother took refuge in Spain. In May 1808 they were forced to leave Spain by Napoleon who arrested Charles Louis' mother in a convent in Rome. Between 1811 and 1814 Charles Louis was placed under the care of his grandfather, the deposed King Charles IV of Spain. After Napoleon's fall, in 1817, Infanta Maria Luisa became Duchess of Lucca in her own right and Charles Louis, age sixteen, became hereditary Prince of Lucca. In 1820 he married Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy. They were a mismatched couple and had only one surviving son. At his mother's death in 1824, Charles Louis became the reigning Duke of Lucca as Charles I. He had little interest in ruling. He left the duchy in the hands of his ministers and spent most of his time traveling around Europe. A liberal movement led him to abdicate Lucca in favor of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in October 1847 in exchange for financial compensation, as he wanted to retire to private life. Two months later, in December 1847, at the death of the former Empress Marie Louise, he succeeded her as the reigning Duke of Parma according to what had been stipulated by the Congress of Vienna. His reign in Parma as Duke Charles II was brief. He was ill- received by his new subjects and within a few months he was ousted by a revolution. He regained control of Parma under the protection of Austrian troops, but finally abdicated in favor of his son Charles III on 14 March 1849. His son was assassinated in 1854 and his grandson Robert I, the last reigning Duke of Parma, was deposed in 1860. In exile Charles Louis assumed the title of count of Villafranca. He spent the last years of his life mostly in France, dying at Nice on 16 April 1883.\"",

Aravindan. A mythological film, its story was adapted from C. N. Sreekantan Nair's play of the same name, which is a reworking of Valmiki's\" Ramayana\". The film interprets a story from the\" Uttara Kanda\" of the epic poem\" Ramayana\", where Rama sends his wife, Sita, to the jungle to satisfy his subjects. Sita is never actually seen in the film, but her virtual presence is compellingly evoked in the moods of the forest and the elements. The film retells the epic from a feminist perspective. It was shot in the interior tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh. The roles of the epic heroes are played by Rama Chenchu tribal people, who claim lineage to the mythological Rama. Director Aravindan interweaves the\" Samkhya Yoga\" philosophical concepts of\" PrakritiPurusha\" bonds throughout the film. The film was produced by K. Ravindran Nair under the banner of General Pictures. The film features an original score by classical musician Rajeev Taranath, cinematography by cinematographer- turned- director Shaji N. Karun, editing by Ramesan, and art direction by Artist Namboothiri. The film became a major critical success upon its release in 1977, although a few mainstream critics panned it. It is credited with being at the forefront of a trend towards independent filmmaking in South India. The film earned Aravindan the National Film Award for Best Direction.\"",

When he was a teenager, he began his journalist job in the Magacine Fray Mochoy, and in the newspapers Cr\u00edtica y \u00daltima Hora. His first play, \"Teatro breve\" is from 1919 with the collaboration of Ivo Pelay. He wrote 180 more. In 1922 the most famous, \"El bailar\u00edn del cabaret\", was staged with the C\u00e9sar Ratti's company, where Corsini triunf\u00f3 (had a success) with \"Patotero sentimental\". In 1923 he travelled to Europe with Luis Bay\u00f3n Herrera. In Paris, where he acted on several plays, he met Carlos Gardel and the idea of filmmaking was born.

The film starred Tita Merello, Irma C\u00f3rdoba, Enrique Serrano and Fernando Ochoa. He filmed very quickly, he only wanted to finish and achieve a good result. His films were rejected by critics and intellectuals as a result, but ordinary people liked his style because they knew him from radio of variety shows.

He also wrote about 500 cabaret songs, chamber music, and orchestral and choral works. His original name was actually Strauss, but for professional purposes he deliberately omitted the final 's', since he wished not to be associated with the musical Strauss family of Vienna. However, he did follow the advice of Johann Strauss II in 1898 about abandoning the prospective lure of writing waltzes for the more lucrative business of writing for the theatre. The son of a Jewish family, he studied music in Berlin under Max Bruch, and became an orchestral conductor, working at the \u00dcberbrettl cabaret. He went back to Vienna and began writing operettas, becoming a serious rival to Franz Leh\u00e1r. When Leh\u00e1r's popular \"The Merry Widow\" premiered in 1905, Straus was said to have remarked \"Das kann ich auch!\" (I can also do that!). In 1939, following the Nazi Anschluss, he fled to Paris, where he received the honour of a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, and then to Hollywood. After the war, he returned to Europe, and settled at Bad Ischl, where he died. His grave is in the Bad Ischl Friedhof. Straus' best-known works are \"Ein WalzertraumA Waltz Dream\"), and \"The Chocolate SoldierDer tapfere Soldat\"). The waltz arrangement from the former is probably his most enduring orchestral work. Among his most famous works is the theme from the 1950 film \"La Ronde\".\"",

She was noted for her humanitarian efforts to save Romanian Jews during World War II, which led to her being awarded by the State of Israel with the honorific of \"Righteous Among the Nations\" in 1993. Daughter of King Constantine I of Greece and his wife, Princess Sophia of Prussia, Princess Helen spent her childhood in Greece, Great Britain and Germany. The outbreak of World War I and the overthrow of her father by the Allies in 1917 permanently marked her and also separated her from her favorite brother, the young Alexander I of Greece. Exiled in Switzerland along with most members of the royal family, Helen then spent several months caring for her father, plagued by disease and depression. In 1920, the princess met Carol, Crown Prince of Romania, who quickly asked her hand in marriage. Despite the bad reputation of the prince, Helen accepted and moved to Romania, where she soon gave birth to their only son, Prince Michael, in 1921. The situation of her family, however, continued to worry Helen, who made several trips abroad to visit her parents when they did not simply reside with her in Bucharest. In doing this, she distanced herself from her husband, whose multiple affairs ended when he fell in love with Magda Lupescu in 1924. Finally, in 1925, Prince Carol abandoned his wife and renounced the throne in order to live openly with his mistress. Distraught, Helen tried to persuade her husband to return to her but eventually she accepted the divorce in 1928. In the meanwhile, Helen was proclaimed \"Queen Mother of Romania\" in 1927, as her son Michael ascended to the throne under the regency of his uncle Prince Nicholas. However, the political situation in Romania was complicated and Carol took advantage of the increased instability to return to Bucharest in 1930 and be acclaimed as king. Soon, the new ruler forced his ex-wife into exile and only authorized her to see their son two months per year. In these circumstances, Helen moved to Villa Sparta at Fiesole, Tuscany. Always close to her family, she hosted her sisters Irene and Katherine and brother Paul, who stayed with her intermittently until the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935. The outbreak of World War II, the deposition of Carol II and the subsequent dismemberment of Greater Romania in 1940, however, brought Helen back to be with her son in Bucharest. Subject to the dictatorship of General Antonescu and vigilance of Nazi Germany, the king and his mother were cautious in their dealings with the fascist regime. They did not show their opposition to the participation of Romania in the invasion of the Soviet Union and the deportation of Jews. Finally, King Michael organized a coup against Antonescu on 23 August 1944 and Romania turned against the Axis powers; however, the country was, in the end, occupied by the Red Army. For Helen and her son, the post-war period was marked by the interference of the Soviet Union in the Romanian political life. In March 1945, the king was forced to accept a communist government headed by Petru Groza while the following year, the general elections confirmed the hegemony of the PCR in the country. Finally, Michael I was forced to abdicate on 30 December 1947 and the royal family took the path of exile. Helen then returned to the Villa Sparta, where she divided her time among her family, gardening and the study of Italian art. Increasingly concerned about her finances, Helen finally left Italy for Switzerland in 1979 and died three years later with her son at her side.\"",

He was the only son of Louis, Prince of Piacenza, and his wife Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain. Born at the Royal Palace of Madrid at the court of his maternal grandfather King Charles IV of Spain, he spent his first years living at the Spanish court. In 1801, by the Treaty of Aranjuez, Charles became Crown Prince of Etruria, a newly created kingdom formed from territories of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Charles moved to Italy with his parents and in 1803, not yet four years old, he succeeded his father as King of Etruria under the name Charles Louis I. His mother Infanta Maria Luisa assumed the regency while Charles Louis' minority lasted. In 1807 Napoleon Bonaparte dissolved the kingdom of Etruria and Charles Louis and his mother took refuge in Spain. In May 1808 they were forced to leave Spain by Napoleon who arrested Charles Louis' mother in a convent in Rome. Between 1811 and 1814 Charles Louis was placed under the care of his grandfather, the deposed King Charles IV of Spain. After Napoleon's fall, in 1817, Infanta Maria Luisa became Duchess of Lucca in her own right and Charles Louis, age sixteen, became hereditary Prince of Lucca. In 1820 he married Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy. They were a mismatched couple and had only one surviving son. At his mother's death in 1824, Charles Louis became the reigning Duke of Lucca as Charles I. He had little interest in ruling. He left the duchy in the hands of his ministers and spent most of his time traveling around Europe. A liberal movement led him to abdicate Lucca in favor of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in October 1847 in exchange for financial compensation, as he wanted to retire to private life. Two months later, in December 1847, at the death of the former Empress Marie Louise, he succeeded her as the reigning Duke of Parma according to what had been stipulated by the Congress of Vienna. His reign in Parma as Duke Charles II was brief. He was ill- received by his new subjects and within a few months he was ousted by a revolution. He regained control of Parma under the protection of Austrian troops, but finally abdicated in favor of his son Charles III on 14 March 1849. His son was assassinated in 1854 and his grandson Robert I, the last reigning Duke of Parma, was deposed in 1860. In exile Charles Louis assumed the title of count of Villafranca. He spent the last years of his life mostly in France, dying at Nice on 16 April 1883.\"",

In January 1658, Charles Stewart went into exile in France, and took up his residence in the house of his uncle, Ludovic, seigneur d'Aubigny. In the following year he fell under the displeasure of The Protectorate's Council of State, and warrants were issued for seizing his person and goods. Charles Stewart married, firstly, Elizabeth Rogers, after June 1659. He married, secondly, Margaret Banaster (widow of William Lewis) on 31 March 1662. He married, thirdly, Frances Teresa Stewart, granddaughter of Walter Stewart, 1st Lord Blantyre, in March 1667. This last marriage was famous, as Frances Stewart, known at court as \"Le Belle Stuart\" had been desired by Richmond's cousin, King Charles II, as a mistress. Charles Stewart returned to England with Charles II in 1660, and sat in the Convention Parliament, showing great animosity towards the supporters of the Commonwealth. On the death of his 10-year-old cousin Esm\u00e9 Stewart on 10 August 1660, Charles Stewart succeeded as third Duke of Richmond and sixth Duke of Lennox. In that same year he was created Hereditary Great Chamberlain of Scotland, Hereditary Great Admiral of Scotland, and Lord-Lieutenant of Dorset. On 15 April 1661 he was invested with the Order of the Garter. On the death of his uncle, Ludovic Stuart, he succeeded him as 12th Seigneur D'Aubigny, for which title he did homage by proxy to Louis XIV of France on 11 May 1670. In July 1667, on the death of his cousin, Mary Butler, countess of Arran, he became Baron Clifton, and on 4 May 1668 he was made lord lieutenant and vice admiral of Kent jointly with the Earl of Winchilsea. In 1671 he was sent as ambassador to the Danish court to persuade Denmark to join England and France in a projected attack on the Dutch. While there he died (by drowning) in 1672, aged 33 at Elsinore, without issue, and his titles became extinct, with the exception of Baron Clifton, which passed with most of his property to his sister Katherine, Lady O'Brien. His wife, however, had had the Lennox estates granted to her for life. He was buried on 20 September 1673 at Westminster Abbey. The titles Duke of Richmond, Duke of Lennox and Earl of March, were resurrected for Charles II's illegitimate son by Louise de K\u00e9rouaille, Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond and Lennox, in 1675.\"",

Stewart, his older brother Henry, and younger brother Ludovic were brought up at Aubigny in France as Roman Catholics under the charge of their paternal grandmother, the old Duchess-Dowager, Katherine de Balsac. Stewart's father, the Duke of Lennox, died in 1624, and Stewart became a ward of his cousin, King Charles I of England. He inherited the Lordship of Aubigny at the age of 14 on the death of his elder brother Henry in 1632. By 1633, he was a student at the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre, part of the University of Paris, and he did homage to Louis XIII of France for the lordship of Aubigny on 5 August 1636, shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Later that year he moved to England. In 1638 he secretly married Katherine Howard, the daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, and Elizabeth Home, without her father's consent, offending his guardian the king. The portrait of Stewart by Anthony van Dyck, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, may have been painted to mark his marriage; the Latin inscription can be translated \"Love is stronger than I am\" which may allude to his conflicting loyalties. His younger brothers Lords John and Bernard are shown in a still more famous double Van Dyck portrait in the National Gallery, London - the iconic image of Cavaliers. They were also both killed in the Civil War. George Stewart and Katherine Howard had two children: He fought with the French against the Spanish in the Battle of Montju\u00efc (1641). As civil war loomed in England, Stewart joined the forces of King Charles at York where he was knighted on 18 April 1642 along with his brother Bernard. He was mortally wounded in the first pitched battle of the war at Edgehill on Sunday 23 October 1642, aged 24. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The lordship of Aubigny passed to his next brother, Ludovic, on his death. His widow remarried James Levingston, 1st Earl of Newburgh and had one further child Elizabeth. They were suspected in 1648 of plotting to rescue Charles I and on the discovery of the supposed plot fled to the Netherlands where Katherine died in 1650.\"",

By her marriage to Henry III of Navarre (later Henry IV of France), she was queen of Navarre and then France at her husband's 1589 accession to the latter throne. She was the daughter of King Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici and the sister of kings Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III. Her marriage, which was intended to celebrate the reconciliation of Catholics and Huguenots, was tarnished by the St Bartholomew's Day massacre, and the resumption of the religious troubles which ensued. In the conflict between Henry III and the Malcontents, she took the side of Francis, Duke of Anjou, her younger brother, and this caused the king to have a deep aversion towards her. As Queen of Navarre, she also played a pacifying role in the stormy relations between her husband and the French monarchy. Shuttled back and forth between the two courts, she endeavored to lead a happy conjugal life, but her sterility and the political tensions inherent in the French Wars of Religion caused the end of her marriage. Mistreated by a brother quick to take offence and rejected by a fickle and opportunistic husband, she chose the path of opposition in 1585. She took the side of the Catholic League and was forced to live in Auvergne in an exile which lasted twenty years. In 1599, she consented to the annulment of the marriage only after the payment of a generous compensation. A well-known woman of letters and an enlightened mind as well as an extremely generous patron , she played a considerable part in the cultural life of the court, especially after her return from exile in 1605. She was a vector of Neoplatonism, which preached the supremacy of platonic love over physical love. While imprisoned, she took advantage of the time to write her \"Memoirs\". She was the first woman to have done so. She was one of the most fashionable women of her time, and influenced many of Europe's royal courts with her clothing. After her death the anecdotes and slanders circulated about her created a legend, which was consolidated around the nickname \"La Reine Margot\" invented by Alexandre Dumas p\u00e8re, handed down through the centuries the myth of a nymphomaniac and incestuous woman. At the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, historians have reviewed the extensive chronicles of her life, concluding that many elements of her scandalous reputation stemmed from anti-Valois propaganda and from a fationalism capable of denigrating the participation of women in politics, created by Bourbon dynasty court historians in the 17th century.\"",

Competing for the San Francisco Olympic Club at the 1952 Olympic Trials, Mattos finished third behind Richards and Don Laz( equalling Laz' height at 4.40 m but losing on fewer misses). Those two would finish in that order at the Olympics, while Mattos only managed 4.20 and finished 9th. In 1953, competing for the U.S. Army, Mattos tied Laz to win the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. The Army notation might be in error as Mattos competed for the U.S. Air Force at the 1956 Olympic Trials. This proved to be a highly competitive trials as seven competitors all equalled the trials record at 4.48 m. At the next height, a new record, only Mattos and Richards survived but Laz, Bob Gutowski and Ron Morris all knocked the bar off with their poles( a critical rule at the time), rather than the normal failure to clear the bar. While Gutowski finished 4th, he replaced the injured Jim Graham on the Olympic team that went to the Olympics in December that year. Gutowski finished second behind Richards in the Olympics. Mattos jumped only 4.35 at the Olympics, but only Georgios Roubanis, a Greek UCLA student kept Mattos from completing an American sweep of the event. Mattos finished amongst the top 6 at the American championships for ten years in a row, 1950- 1959.\"",

De Mendieta was born in Bouvignes- sur- Meuse in 1907 and entered the novitiate at Maredsous in 1925 \u2014 shortly before the Malines Conversations between Roman Catholics and Anglicans\u2014and was given the name of Dom David. He was professed in 1930. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1932. He became a noted patristics scholar and an international authority on St. Basil of Caesarea. In 1956 de Mendieta announced his conversion to the Church of England. He left Belgium and moved to Great Britain, where he was received into the Church. After several years of teaching at various smaller colleges, he was named a canon, that is a canon residentiary, of Winchester Cathedral and thus a member of the Cathedral Chapter. Of studious disposition his career at the cathedral reflected his monastic experience in his general lack of knowledge of some standard procedures of modern life. Publishing in several European languages, he continued to live a relatively secluded existence after his move to England. De Mendieta's acceptance of an office in the Anglican Church invited a journalist's comparison with the case of de Dominis' appointment to the Deanery of Windsor under King James I. It was also subsequently noted that the 20th- century cleric, Charles Davis, did not opt for a similar route when he left the Roman Catholic Church.

Extremely explicit for its day, and for some time afterward (to the point where the film was not passed uncut by the British Board of Film Classification until 2011), \"Taxi zum Klo\" was considered groundbreaking for the subject matter it portrayed, and achieved something of a cult status among gay audiences of the time. In 1987, Ripploh directed a sequel entitled \"Taxi nach Kairo\", but the film was not considered as successful as its predecessor, and it was not released outside Germany. Ripploh also participated in the creation of a small number of other art house films during the 1980s, and had a role in the 1982 movie \"Querelle\" directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Ripploh died of cancer in 2002.\"",

For much of the Napoleonic Wars he was in command of the Austrian army. Ferdinand was born at Milan. He attended the military academy in Wiener Neustadt before embarking on a military career. In 1805 in the war of the Third Coalition against France, Ferdinand was commander-in-chief of the Austrian forces with General Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich as his quartermaster general. In October his army was surrounded at Ulm. General Mack surrendered, but Ferdinand managed to escape with 2000 cavalry to Bohemia. There he took command of the Austrian troops and raised the local militia. With a total of 9,000 men he set out for Iglau to distract attention from the Coalition's movements. He succeeded in holding the Bavarian division of Prince Karl Philipp von Wrede in Iglau thereby and preventing it from joining the Battle of Austerlitz. In 1809 in the war of the Fifth Coalition against France, Ferdinand commanded an Austrian army of 36,000 men. In April he invaded the Duchy of Warsaw hoping to encourage a local uprising against Napoleon (see Polish\u2013Austrian War). But the Poles rallied to Prince J\u00f3zef Antoni Poniatowski. Ferdinand was defeated at the Battle of Raszyn, but managed to occupy Warsaw. In June, however, Ferdinand was compelled to withdraw from Warsaw, and to give up Krak\u00f3w and Galicia as well. In 1815 in the war of the Seventh Coalition against France, Ferdinand commanded two divisions of the Austrian Reserve. The following year he was appointed military commander in Hungary. In 1830 Ferdinand was appointed military and civil governor of Galicia, taking up residence in Lviv. After the Revolution of 1848 he resided mostly in Italy. Ferdinand never married. In 1850 he died at Schloss Ebenzweier in Altm\u00fcnster near Gmunden, Austria.\"",

The film tells the story of a schizophrenic young woman (Andersson) vacationing with her family on a remote island, during which time her author father attempts to use her illness in his work, her brother experiences sexual frustration, and she experiences delusions about meeting God, who appears to her in the form of a monstrous spider. Bergman structured the film as a three-act play, drawing on his personal experiences and relationships. The film was his first of several shot on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6, at the recommendation of cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The score incorporates the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Themes explored include the equation of God with love, exploitation in art, psychosis, and sexuality. \"Through a Glass Darkly\" was released to positive reviews, specifically for Andersson's performance, and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

Later he worked as a script clerk for directors King Vidor and Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m before becoming a screenwriter at MGM in 1924. Lewin was appointed head of the studio's script department and by the late 1920s was Irving Thalberg's personal assistant and closest associate. Nominally credited as an associate producer, he produced several of MGM's most important films of the 1930s. After Thalberg's death, he joined Paramount as a producer in 1937, where he remained until 1941. Notable producing credits during this period include \"True Confession\" (1937), \"Spawn of the North\" (1938), \"Zaza\" (1939) and \"So Ends Our Night\" (1941). In 1942, Lewin began to direct.

Known for his elegance and impeccable manners, he was, by the people who knew him, known as\" the prince\". Waszy\u0144ski was born as Mosze Waks into a Polish Jewish family as Micha\u0142 Waks in 1904 in Kowel, a small town in Volhynia( now in Ukraine), which at the time was part of Imperial Russia. As Germany occupied this part of Europe during World War I, he moved first to Warsaw and later to Berlin. As a young man he worked as an assistant director of the legendary German director F.W. Murnau. Upon his return to Poland he changed his name to Micha\u0142 Waszy\u0144ski and converted to Catholicism. In the 1930s Waszy\u0144ski became the most prolific film director in Poland, directing 37 of the 147 films made in Poland in that decade, nearly one out of four. Along with the popular films in Polish directed to a wide local audience, he directed an important film in Yiddish\" The Dybbuk\", today a monument of the rich cultural life of East European Jewry before the Holocaust. At the beginning of World War II Waszy\u0144ski escaped from Warsaw, which was being bombed by German planes, to Bia\u0142ystok. That city was taken in mid-September 1939 by the Germans, but within weeks, as a result of the Molotov- Ribbentrop pact, the city was given to the Soviet Union and occupied by its army. Waszy\u0144ski began a new career as a theater director, first in Bia\u0142ystok and later in Moscow. In the summer of 1941, after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Waszy\u0144ski joined the newly formed Polish Army of general W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders( loyal to the Polish government in Exile in London) and subsequently was relocated to Persia( Iran), and later as a soldier of the 2nd Corps of the Polish Army to Egypt and Italy. As a member of the army film unit, he filmed the Battle of Monte Cassino, where the Polish Army suffered great losses, but helped to win the day. After World War II, he stayed in Italy, where he directed a Polish- language feature film about the Battle of Monte Cassino, and then three Italian films. Later in his career, Waszy\u0144ski worked as a producer for the major American studios in Italy and( primarily) Spain, credited as\" Michael Waszynski\". His credits include\" The Quiet American\"( 1958)( associate producer),\" El Cid\"( 1961), and\" The Fall of the Roman Empire( film)\"( 1964)( executive producer and associate producer). He died of a heart attack on 20 February 1965 in Madrid, and was buried in a ceremonious Catholic funeral in Rome.\"",

His reign represented the height of the Mughal architecture, most notably the Taj Mahal. His relationship with his wife Mumtaz Mahal has been heavily adapted into Indian art, literature, and cinema. Shah Jahan was widely considered the most competent of Emperor Jahangir's four sons and after Jahangir's death in late 1627, when a war of succession ensued, Shah Jahan emerged victorious. He put to death all of his rivals for the throne and crowned himself emperor in January 1628 in Agra under the regnal title \"Shah Jahan\" (which was originally given to him as a princely title). Although an able military commander, Shah Jahan is perhaps best remembered for his architectural achievements. The period of his reign is widely considered the golden age of Mughal architecture. Shah Jahan commissioned many monuments, the best known of which is the Taj Mahal in Agra, which entombs his wife Mumtaz Mahal. In September 1657, Shah Jahan fell seriously ill. This set off a war of succession among his four sons in which his third son, Aurangzeb, emerged victorious. Shah Jahan recovered from his illness, but Aurangzeb put his father under house arrest in Agra Fort from July 1658 until his death in January 1666. On 31 July 1658, Aurangzeb crowned himself emperor under the title \"Alamgir\". The Mughal Empire reached the pinnacle of its glory during Shah Jahan's reign and he is widely considered to be one of the greatest Mughal emperors.\"",

He directed and wrote over films between 1931 and 1951 even composing the musical scores for several. He was a pioneer of Variety Theatre, and one of the few tango lyrical writers that has reached timeless classical success. When he was a teenager, he began his journalist job in the Magacine Fray Mochoy, and in the newspapers Cr\u00edtica y \u00daltima Hora. His first play, \"Teatro breve\" is from 1919 with the collaboration of Ivo Pelay. He wrote 180 more. In 1922 the most famous, \"El bailar\u00edn del cabaret\", was staged with the C\u00e9sar Ratti's company, where Corsini triunf\u00f3 (had a success) with \"Patotero sentimental\". In 1923 he travelled to Europe with Luis Bay\u00f3n Herrera. In Paris, where he acted on several plays, he met Carlos Gardel and the idea of filmmaking was born. He wrote the plot and songs for \"Luces de Buenos Aires\", directed by the Chilean Adelqui Millar. It starred Gloria Guzm\u00e1n, Sof\u00eda Boz\u00e1n, Pedro Quartucci and the Julio De Caro musical group. He returned to Buenos Aires, where he introduced the new ideas taken from music hall and varieties shows. He started to work at the Lumit\u00f3n cinema company, with Enrique Tel\u00e9maco Susini . With that film company, released in February 1935, \"Noches de Buenos Aires\", written and directed by Romero, his cinema career began. The film starred Tita Merello, Irma C\u00f3rdoba, Enrique Serrano and Fernando Ochoa. He filmed very quickly, he only wanted to finish and achieve a good result. His films were rejected by critics and intellectuals as a result, but ordinary people liked his style because they knew him from radio of variety shows. He directed films such as Adi\u00f3s pampa m\u00eda in 1946.\"",

On his father's death, he received the march of Antwerp and became a vassal of his brother, Godfrey II, who became duke of Lower Lorraine in 1012. He succeeded his brother in 1023 with the support of the Emperor Henry II, but was opposed until Conrad II forced the rebels to submit in 1025. When the House of Bar, which ruled in Upper Lorraine, became extinct in 1033, with the death of his cousin Frederick III, Conrad made him duke of both duchies, so that he could assist in the defence of the territory against Odo II, count of Blois, Meaux, Chartres, and Troyes( the later Champagne). In the battle at Bar on 15 November 1037, Gothelo dealt a decisive blow to Odo, who was trying to create an independent state between France and Germany. Odo died in the battle. Gothelo died on 19 April 1044 and was buried in the Abbey Church of Bilzen. His son Godfrey succeeded in Upper Lorraine, but the Emperor Henry III refused to give him the duchy of Lower Lorraine as well. When Godfrey showed disagreement with the imperial decision, Henry III threatened to pass the duchy to Godfrey's incompetent brother Gothelo. This caused a long rebellion in Lotharingia between the allies of Godfrey( the counts of Flanders and Leuven) and imperial forces( 1044 \u2013 1056).\"",

Bergman directed over sixty films and documentaries for cinematic release and for television screenings, most of which he also wrote. He also directed over 170 plays. He eventually forged a creative partnership with his cinematographers Gunnar Fischer and Sven Nykvist. Among his company of actors were Harriet and Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, Erland Josephson, Ingrid Thulin and Max von Sydow. Most of his films were set in Sweden, and many films from \"Through a Glass Darkly\" (1961) onward were filmed on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6. Philip French referred to Bergman as \"one of the greatest artists of the 20th century ... he found in literature and the performing arts a way of both recreating and questioning the human condition.\" Director Martin Scorsese commented; \"If you were alive in the 50s and the 60s and of a certain age, a teenager on your way to becoming an adult, and you wanted to make movies , I don't see how you couldn't be influenced by Bergman ...

Baker first met Khan when she attended one of his lectures in San Francisco, after which the pair quickly fell in love. However, resistance from Baker's family prevented them from marrying until 1913, at which point she took the name \"Ameena Begum\". After living in London and Moscow for a time, the family settled in Suresnes, near Paris. She left a collection of 101 poems, \"A Rosary of one hundred and one beads\". Some poems were lost during World War II, but 54 have been preserved and were published in 1998. She was a cousin of Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Christian Science Church in the USA. Hidayat Inayat Khan wrote: \"In 1926, Hazrat Inayat Khan gave my Mother an exceptional initiation as \"Pirani\", which was only to be given to her.

When Badi-al Zaman's father died in 1549, he, along with his other siblings were taken care of by Tahmasp, who even announced Badi-al Zaman as his own son. Badi al-Zaman was appointed as the governor of Sistan in 1557, and married Pari Khan Khanum (who was at that time 10 years old). However, since she was Tahmasp's favored daughter, she was not allowed to go alongside her husband to Sistan. According to the other historians, however, Pari Khan Khanum was only engaged to Badi al-Zaman, which according to Gholsorkhi seems more believable. Allegedly the marriage went no farther, since Pari Khan Khanum chose a bureaucratic life in the capital, alongside her father, over married life in Sistan.

Murray had planned to travel to Sydney, to join the Redfern All Blacks Rugby League team's tour of New Zealand when he was detained. Police claimed that they found Murray hanging in his cell at the Wee Waa Police Station around 3:30 pm, and argued that he committed suicide, although this occurred prior to the majority of Aboriginal deaths in custody which were later examined in the 1987 Royal Commission. He was 21 years old at the time. Eddie Murray's parents, Leila Jane( n\u00e9e Button) and Arthur Edward Murray remained unconvinced that their son's death was a suicide, and fought for a more extensive investigation into Murray's death. Murray's death has helped to draw attention to the issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody. Murray's case has drawn the attention of several investigations, including the Muirhead Royal Commission, the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board Report on Street offences, and his case was one of the first to be investigated by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1988. In 1997, Murray's body was exhumed and re-autopsied, revealing a previously undetected smashed sternum, and a forensic pathologist determined that the injury had most likely occurred immediately prior to his death. Despite this, the details of his death remain a mystery, and still no one has been officially implicated in his death. This has been to the dissatisfaction of Murray's family, who have called for a more extensive inquiry.\"",

Cavendish was the only son of William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle and his first wife, Elizabeth Basset. His maternal grandparents were William Basset and Judith Austen, daughter of Thomas Austen. After the Restoration of the Monarchy he was appointed Master of the Robes (June 1660-62) and a Gentleman of the Bedchamber (1662\u201368). In April 1660, Lord Mansfield was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Derbyshire in the Convention Parliament. He was elected MP for Northumberland in 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament. In 1676 he inherited the title of Duke of Newcastle and the family seat of Welbeck Abbey on the death of his father and was invested a Knight of the Garter in 1677. He died in 1691, leaving no surviving male heir and thus the dukedom became extinct. Welbeck Abbey and other East Midlands estates passed to his favourite daughter Margaret, who had married John Holles, for whom the dukedom was recreated in 1694. The bequest was unsuccessfully contested by Cavendish's other daughters.\"",

With her husband, she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of Ancient Egyptian history. Some scholars believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as Neferneferuaten after her husband's death and before the accession of Tutankhamun, although this identification is a matter of ongoing debate. If Nefertiti did rule as Pharaoh, her reign was marked by the fall of Amarna and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of Thebes. Nefertiti had many titles including Hereditary Princess (iryt-p`t); Great of Praises (wrt-Hzwt); Lady of Grace (nbt-im3t), Sweet of Love (bnrt-mrwt); Lady of The Two Lands (nbt-t3wy); Main King's Wife, his beloved (Hmt-nswt-\u20183t mryt.f); Great King's Wife, his beloved (Hmt-nswt-wrt mryt.f), Lady of All Women (Hnwt-Hmwt-nbwt); and Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt (Hnwt-Shm\u2019w-mhw).

Murray had planned to travel to Sydney, to join the Redfern All Blacks Rugby League team's tour of New Zealand when he was detained. Police claimed that they found Murray hanging in his cell at the Wee Waa Police Station around 3:30 pm, and argued that he committed suicide, although this occurred prior to the majority of Aboriginal deaths in custody which were later examined in the 1987 Royal Commission. He was 21 years old at the time. Eddie Murray's parents, Leila Jane( n\u00e9e Button) and Arthur Edward Murray remained unconvinced that their son's death was a suicide, and fought for a more extensive investigation into Murray's death. Murray's death has helped to draw attention to the issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody. Murray's case has drawn the attention of several investigations, including the Muirhead Royal Commission, the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board Report on Street offences, and his case was one of the first to be investigated by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1988. In 1997, Murray's body was exhumed and re-autopsied, revealing a previously undetected smashed sternum, and a forensic pathologist determined that the injury had most likely occurred immediately prior to his death. Despite this, the details of his death remain a mystery, and still no one has been officially implicated in his death. This has been to the dissatisfaction of Murray's family, who have called for a more extensive inquiry.\"",

She was the fifth wife of King of Judea Herod the Great. There is a possibility that Cleopatra could have been a daughter of a local noble from Jerusalem. She was born and raised in the city and could have been of Jewish or Edomite-Phoenician origins. Cleopatra was called \"Cleopatra of Jerusalem\", to distinguish her from the Ptolemaic Greek Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt. Josephus mentions \"Cleopatra of Jerusalem\" twice: once in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\" 17.1.3 and once in his The Jewish War 1.28.4. Cleopatra of Jerusalem was not related to the Hasmonaean Dynasty. She had married King Herod the Great in 25 BC. Herod possibly married her as a part of a political alliance. Cleopatra bore Herod two sons who were: Cleopatra\u2019s children by Herod were raised and educated in Rome. After the death of her husband in 4 BC, her second son inherited some of his father\u2019s dominion and ruled as a Roman client king until his death in 34. Cleopatra became the mother-in-law of Philip\u2019s wife and niece Salome. Philip and Salome had no children.\"",

The King of Jerusalem, Conradin, was executed in 1268 by Charles of Anjou, who had by papal authority seized Conradin's Kingdom of Sicily. At the time of his death, Maria was the only living grandchild of Queen Isabella; this allowed her to claim the throne of Jerusalem on the basis of proximity in blood to the Kings of Jerusalem. The\" Haute Cour\" of Jerusalem passed over her claim, however, and instead chose Hugh III of Cyprus- a great- grandson of Queen Isabella I- as the next ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Maria then went to Rome and proposed the sale of her rights to Charles of Anjou; with papal blessing and confirmation, these were sold to Charles in 1277. Charles then took the title\" King of Jerusalem\", and conquered Acre, holding it until 1285. Thereafter, the claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem frequently changed hands, being passed down by testament or conquest rather than by direct inheritance.

The song was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost out to\" Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\". Alan Bergman would recall that after Michel Legrand had written eight melodies which were somehow not viable for the film, Marilyn Bergman suggested the opening line\" What are you doing the rest of your life?\", and Legrand then completed the song's melody based on that phrase. Marilyn Bergman would later comment on the double meaning of the phrase\" What are you doing the rest of your life?\" within its parent film: as the romantic theme song's title the question overtly references the marriage proposal Mary Spencer( played by Jean Simmons) received and accepted sixteen years earlier but, as Mary's present- day angst becomes apparent,\" What are you doing the rest of your life?\" is recast as a question Mary must ask herself. \" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was sung in\" The Happy Ending\" by Michael Dees whose version was included on the film's soundtrack album. The first evident\" outside\" cover was by Barbra Streisand who recorded the song on 24 September 1969 in the first session for her intended album\" The Singer\", with the track having a single release 26 October 1969. After two later sessions- in respectively March and April of 1970- Streisand had recorded a total of eight tracks toward\" The Singer\", only to have Clive Davis shelve the project in favor of an album which was soft rock rather than easy listening, with Streisand cutting the first tracks for what would be her 1971 album release\" Stoney End\" on 29 July 1970. \" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was utilized as the B-side of Streisand's# 1 hit\" The Way We Were\" released in 1973, and was included on the 1974 album release\" The Way We Were\". Although the Streisand version drew no evident attention in its original single release,\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" did reach the Easy Listening Top 40 ranking in\" Billboard\"- with a# 40 peak- via a January 1970 recording by veteran vocalist Jaye P. Morgan, whose version served as the title cut for her first album release in eight years( and her last until 1976). Also in 1970\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was recorded by Della Reese for her album\" Right Now\": the 9 November 1997 broadcast of the CBS series\" Touched by an Angel\" featured Reese's character; the angel Tess, singing the song in the guise of a supperclub singer .. \" What Are Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was also recorded by Dusty Springfield in 1970, in the July sessions at Trident Studios( Soho) for her\" See All Her Faces\" album, but despite Springfield having had a Top 40 hit with the Bergman's first Oscar- winning composition\" The Windmills of Your Mind\" her version of\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was cut from her upcoming album without being mixed, remaining\" in the can\" until 1994 when Philips Records put together the four volume box set\" Dusty: The Legend Of Dusty Springfield\" with a completed recording of\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" being included on the disc devoted to\" Rarities\"( the track was in fact first released earlier in the year as a bonus on a CD single which paired Springfield's hits\" Goin' Back\" and\" Son- of- a Preacher Man\"). In 2006 Springfield's version of\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was featured in a 60- second commercial for diamonds- sponsored by the Diamond Trading Company- which aired on American television, in cinemas and online. In 1972 Sarah Vaughan recorded\" What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" for the album\" Sarah Vaughan with Michel Legrand\" on which Legrand acted as arranger and conductor. The track would win Legrand the 1972 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying a Vocalist. More than thirty years later, Billy Childs, Gil Goldstein, and Heitor Pereira won the 2006 Grammy Award for the same category for a version performed by trumpeteer Chris Botti and vocalist Sting on Botti's 2005 album\" To Love Again\". There is also a song called\" What Are You Doin' the Rest of Your Life?\" in the 1944 film\" Hollywood Canteen\", performed by Jack Carson and Jane Wyman with the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra.\"",

However, Godfrey was also count of Bidgau and Methingau from 959, so there is no reason to believe that Rudolfe was not count until his death in 963. Rudolfe was overthrown as Count of Ivois by \u00c9tienne, Count of Porcien( year unknown), and replaced as Count of Verdun in 963 by Godfrey.\"",

He was a son of Oswiu of Northumbria and a brother of Ecgfrith of Northumbria. After the succession of Ecgfrith as king of Northumbria in 670, he made \u00c6lfwine king of the sub-kingdom of Deira. \u00c6lfwine was still a boy at the time, and the title may have been intended to designate him as the heir of the childless Ecgfrith. He was, however, killed in battle against the Mercians at the Battle of the Trent in 679. Although his death could have led to an escalation of the war, further conflict was averted by the intervention of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore, and King \u00c6thelred of Mercia paid a \"weregild\" to Ecgfrith in compensation for \u00c6lfwine's death. Bede writes: \u201cIn the ninth year of the reign of King Ecgfrith (in 679), a great battle was fought between him and \u00c6thelred, king of the Mercians, near the river Trent, and \u00c6lfwine, brother to King Ecgfrith, was slain, a youth about eighteen years of age, and much beloved by both provinces; for King \u00c6thelred had married his sister Osthryth. There was now reason to expect a more bloody war, and more lasting enmity between those kings and their fierce nations; but Theodore, the bishop, beloved of God, relying on the Divine aid, by his wholesome admonitions wholly extinguished the dangerous fire that was breaking out; so that the kings and their people on both sides were appeased, and no man was put to death, but only the due mulct paid to the king who was the avenger for the death of his brother; and this peace continued long after between those kings and between their kingdoms.\u201d\"",

One of the sons of \u00c6thelfrith of Bernicia, Oswiu became king following the death of his brother Oswald in 642. Unlike Oswald, Oswiu struggled to exert authority over Deira, the other constituent kingdom of medieval Northumbria, for much of his reign. Oswiu and his brothers were raised in exile in the Scottish kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata after their father's death at the hands of Edwin of Deira, only returning after Edwin's death in 633. Oswiu rose to the kingship when his brother Oswald was killed in battle against Penda of Mercia. The early part of his reign was defined by struggles to assert control over Deira and his contentious relationship with Penda, his overlord. In 655, Oswiu's forces killed Penda in a decisive victory at the Battle of the Winwaed, establishing Oswiu as one of the most powerful rulers in Britain. He secured control of Deira, with his son Alhfrith serving as a sub-king, and for three years, Oswiu's power extended over Mercia, earning him recognition as \"bretwalda\" over much of Great Britain. Oswiu was a devoted Christian, promoting the faith among his subjects and establishing a number of monasteries, including Gilling Abbey and Whitby Abbey. He was raised in the Celtic Christian tradition of much of the Irish world, rather than the Roman tradition practiced by the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms as well as some members of the Deiran nobility, including Oswiu's queen Eanfl\u00e6d. In 664, Oswiu presided over the Synod of Whitby, where clerics debated over the two traditions, and helped resolve tension between the parties by decreeing that Northumbria would follow the Roman style. Oswiu died in 670 and was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith. His feast is February 15 in the East and in the West.\"",

His mother was Ida of Lorraine. In 1088, Eustace supported the rebellion against William II of England in favour of Robert Curthose. Eustace participated in the First Crusade of 1096 along with his brothers Godfrey of Bouillon (duke of Lower Lotharingia) and Baldwin of Boulogne. It is unclear whether he travelled eastward with his brother Godfrey's or Robert Curthose's army. His contingent included Hugh II of Saint-Pol and his son Engelrand, Eustace I Granarius, lord of Sidon and Caesarea, Fulk of Gu\u00eenes, and Hugh of Robecq (Rebecques), lord of Hebron. Throughout the crusade Eustace assisted Godfrey. Eustace was present at the Siege of Nicaea (May\u2013June 1097), helped rescue Bohemund of Taranto's beleaguered troops at the Battle of Dorylaeum (July 1, 1097), defeated an enemy ambush during the Siege of Antioch and was one of the commanders during the capture of Antioch on June 3, 1098. Eustace was a member of the council held at Ruj on January 4, 1099, mediating in the conflict over the control of Antioch between Bohemund of Taranto and Raymond IV of Toulouse. Early December 1098 Eustace joined Raymond's attack on Maarrat al-Nu'man and an attack on Nablus in July 1099. He gained notoriety for his actions during the Siege of Jerusalem fighting relentlessly from a siege tower along with his brother Godfrey and the warriors they commanded. They were among the first to breach Jerusalem's city walls and participated in the ensuing massacre. Finally Eustace commanded a division of the crusader army during the Battle of Ascalon. While his brothers stayed in the Holy Land, Eustace returned to administer his domains. To commemorate Eustace's crusading adventures the mint at Boulogne struck silver coins with a lion above the walls of Jerusalem stamped on the obverse. Eustace married Mary, daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland and Saint Margaret of Scotland. Eustace and Mary had one daughter: When his youngest brother king Baldwin I of Jerusalem died in 1118, the elderly Eustace was offered the throne. Eustace was at first uninterested, but was convinced to accept it; he travelled all the way to Apulia before learning that a distant relative, Baldwin of Bourcq, had been crowned in the meantime. Eustace returned to Boulogne and died about 1125. On his death the county of Boulogne was inherited by his daughter, Matilda, and her husband Stephen de Blois, count of Mortain, afterwards king of England. Eustace founded the Cluniac house of Rumilly and was patron of the Knights Templar.\"",

He was a son of Oswiu of Northumbria and a brother of Ecgfrith of Northumbria. After the succession of Ecgfrith as king of Northumbria in 670, he made \u00c6lfwine king of the sub-kingdom of Deira. \u00c6lfwine was still a boy at the time, and the title may have been intended to designate him as the heir of the childless Ecgfrith. He was, however, killed in battle against the Mercians at the Battle of the Trent in 679. Although his death could have led to an escalation of the war, further conflict was averted by the intervention of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore, and King \u00c6thelred of Mercia paid a \"weregild\" to Ecgfrith in compensation for \u00c6lfwine's death. Bede writes: \u201cIn the ninth year of the reign of King Ecgfrith (in 679), a great battle was fought between him and \u00c6thelred, king of the Mercians, near the river Trent, and \u00c6lfwine, brother to King Ecgfrith, was slain, a youth about eighteen years of age, and much beloved by both provinces; for King \u00c6thelred had married his sister Osthryth. There was now reason to expect a more bloody war, and more lasting enmity between those kings and their fierce nations; but Theodore, the bishop, beloved of God, relying on the Divine aid, by his wholesome admonitions wholly extinguished the dangerous fire that was breaking out; so that the kings and their people on both sides were appeased, and no man was put to death, but only the due mulct paid to the king who was the avenger for the death of his brother; and this peace continued long after between those kings and between their kingdoms.\u201d\"",

She probably married \u00c6thelred before 679 and was murdered by the nobles of Mercia. Osthryth was not the first of her family to become a Mercian queen. Her sister Alhfl\u00e6d had married Peada, King of South Mercia 654-656. After the death of Peada, who was allegedly murdered with Alhfl\u00e6d's connivance, and possibly Osthryth's as well, she retreated to Fladbury in Worcestershire, to judge both from the place-name, which means \"stronghold of Fl\u00e6de\", and from its subsequent history: sometime in the 690s \u00c6thelred granted Fladbury to Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester, to re-establish monastic life there; however, this grant was later contested by \u00c6thelheard, son of Oshere, who maintained that \u00c6thelred had no right to give Fladbury away, as it had been the property of Osthryth. \u00c6thelheard claimed it as her kinsman and heir. \u00c6thelred and Osthryth loved and favoured Bardney Abbey in Lincolnshire. Osthryth placed there the bones of her uncle Oswald of Northumbria, who was venerated as a saint. It is clear from this story that Osthryth played a part in promoting the cult of St Oswald. Many years later she persuaded Oswald's widow Cyneburh to take the veil. Osthryth had to contend with major conflicts of loyalty. In 679 her brother Ecgfrith of Northumbria fought a battle against \u00c6thelred, in which Ecgfrith's brother \u00c6lfwine was killed. Bede tells us that he was \"a young man of about eighteen years of age and much beloved in both kingdoms, for King \u00c6thelred had married his sister.\" The murder of Osthryth in 697 by Mercian nobles is unexplained in the sources that mention it. Ann Williams attributes it to the hostility between the Mercians and the Northumbrians, while D. P. Kirby suggests that it may have been revenge for her sister's alleged involvement in Peada's murder. H. P. R. Finberg speculates that she and her kinsman Oshere were suspected of trying to detach the kingdom of the Hwicce from Mercian overlordship. Osthryth was buried at Bardney Abbey. Osthryth was probably the mother of \u00c6thelred's son, Ceolred, king of Mercia from 709 to 716.\"",

A member of the Democratic Party, Brown served as California Attorney General from 2007 to 2011. He was both the oldest and sixth-youngest governor of California as a consequence of the 28-year gap between his second and third terms. Upon completing his fourth term in office, Brown became the third longest-serving governor in United States history, serving 16 years and 7 days in office. Brown was born in San Francisco as the son of Bernice Layne Brown and Pat Brown, who served as the 32nd governor of California (1959\u20131967). After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley and Yale University, he began his political career as a member of the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees (1969\u20131971). He was elected to serve as the 23rd Secretary of State of California from 1971 to 1975. At 36, Brown was elected to his first term as governor of California in 1974, making him the youngest California governor in 111 years. In 1978, he won his second term. During and following his first governorship, Brown ran as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, 1980 and 1992. He declined to pursue a third term in 1982, instead making an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate that same year. After traveling abroad, he returned to California and served as Chairman of the California Democratic Party (1989\u20131991), attempting to run for the Senate once more in 1992. After six years out of politics, Brown returned to public life, serving as Mayor of Oakland (1999\u20132007), and then as Attorney General of California (2007\u20132011). He ran for his third and fourth terms as California governor in 2010 and 2014, his eligibility to do so having stemmed from California's constitutional grandfather clause.

He was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, but he spent most of his adult life in Mexico City, where he died. On 1932, while in New York City, Fernando Cort\u00e9s married Puerto Rican childhood friend Mar\u00eda del Pilar Cordero, who adopted the stage name of Mapy Cort\u00e9s. The couple soon traveled to Spain with a Cuban theatrical troupe. They worked on the Spanish stage, radio and film until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936. Fernando progressively began to take a backseat as actor and baritone and focused on promoting the career of his wife Mapy, who became a noted \"vedette\" (showgirl with star status) in Barcelona. After the Spanish Civil War interrupted their careers, the couple worked in New York, San Juan, Buenos Aires, Havana and Caracas, occasionally starring in movies. They arrived to Mexico City in late 1940 and made their stage debut at the Teatro Follies, in a show headlined by the popular Mexican comedian Cantinflas. Despite early struggles to become household names, Mapy achieved Mexican film stardom in late 1941 and the couple settled in Mexico City. Initially, Fernando Cort\u00e9s played supporting roles in his wife's films. He then made a successful debut as director with \"La p\u00edcara Susana\" (1945) a comedy vehicle for his wife. On March 1954, Fernando and Mapy Cort\u00e9s returned to Puerto Rico to help launch local television. Cort\u00e9s became the first director at WKAQ-TV, Channel 2, and the couple co-starred in \"Mapy y Papi\", the first Puerto Rican sitcom. Despite their success on local TV, the couple returned the following year to Mexico City, which offered more opportunities. The couple starred in a Mexican version of their Puerto Rican sitcom and Mapy returned to the stage. Fernando Cort\u00e9s became known as a reliable director of Mexican comedies on stage, television and film. After writing and directing star vehicles for his wife Mapy in the 1940s and comedians like Resortes and Tin-Tan in the 1950s, Fernando Cort\u00e9s produced and directed Puerto Rican co-productions in the 1960s and launched the film career of La India Mar\u00eda in the 1970s.\"",

He is also the current Chairman of India's multi-national film, media and entertainment conglomerate Yash Raj Films( YRF). Chopra has written and produced a number of films under the banner such as\" Veer- Zaara\"( 2004),\" Fanaa\"( 2006),\" Band Baaja Baaraat\"( 2010),\" Jab Tak Hai Jaan\"( 2012), the\" Dhoom series\"( 2004, 2006& 2013),\" Sultan\"( 2016), the\" Tiger series\"( 2012& 2017) and\" War\"( 2019). He has broken away from typecast through production of off- beat films such as\" Kabul Express\"( 2006),\" Chak De! India\"( 2007),( 2009),\" Dum Laga Ke Haisha\"( 2015) and\" Hichki!\"( 2018), that do not necessarily fit into the realm of\" masala films\". Chopra is also the first to move towards a true film studio model through independent projects helmed by talent under his banner. Major post-production work of the company is now carried out of YRF Studios( co- founded by his ex-wife Payal Khanna), where Chopra serves as Chief Executive. He has produced ten films that have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of more than 200 crore, which is the most for an Indian film producer. In December 2009, Chopra fought a hostile acquisition bid by Walt Disney, valued upwards of 2500 crore, to remain and continue purely as a domestic entity aided by the Tata Sons. Apart from emerging as an equitable brand, his company has earned the status of a movie mogul through distribution networks spread across the globe, estimated to be net worth 7640 crore( FY17/18) by the NSE, thereby making it the biggest and most successful film production company in the history of Indian Cinema. Having denied him admission into the NSD as a young applicant, the Directorate of Film Festivals eventually honored him with the National Award for his achievements in 1995, 2005, 2007 and 2015. The Government of India appealed both Chopra and Mani Ratnam to focus on content created locally under its Make in India initiative, which was later followed by productions like\" Daawat- e- Ishq\"( 2014),\" Meri Pyaari Bindu\"( 2016),\" Sui- Dhaaga\"( 2018) and\" Jayeshbhai Jordaar\"( 2020) planned by his company. In June 2018, he was awarded membership into The Academy by the Producers Guild of America. Widely regarded as one of the most influential and powerful executives in Indian entertainment, Chopra has however rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Yash Chopra's son and the Chief Executive of Yash Raj Films. He has remained extremely media -shy and a passive individual, battling constant reports of an alleged dysthymic disorder throughout his three- decade career, resulting in very few public photos of him being in existence.\"",

He introduced the currency of rupee. An ethnic Pashtun, Sher Shah took control of the Mughal Empire in 1538. After his accidental death in 1545, his son Islam Shah became his successor. He first served as a private before rising to become a commander in the Mughal army under Babur and then the governor of Bihar. In 1537, when Babur's son Humayun was elsewhere on an expedition, Sher Shah overran the state of Bengal and established the Suri dynasty. A brilliant strategist, Sher Shah proved himself as a gifted administrator as well as a capable general. His reorganization of the empire laid the foundations for the later Mughal emperors, notably Akbar, son of Humayun. During his seven-year rule from 1538 to 1545, he set up a new economic and military administration, issued the first \"Rupiya\" from \"Taka\" and organized the postal system of the Indian Subcontinent. Some of his strategies and contributions were later ideolized by the Mughal emperors, most notably Akbar. Suri further developed Humayun's \"Dina-panah\" city and named it Shergarh and revived the historical city of Pataliputra, which had been in decline since the 7th century CE, as Patna. He extended the Grand Trunk Road from Chittagong in the frontiers of the province of Bengal in northeast India to Kabul in Afghanistan in the far northwest of the country. The influence of his innovations and reforms extended far beyond his brief reign; his arch foe, Humayun, referred to him as \u201cUstad-I-Badshahan\u201d, teacher of kings.\"",

He is the author of several well- known historical novels, including:\" Boves, el Urogallo\"( 1972),\" Los Amos del Valle\"( 1979) and\" La Luna de Fausto\"( 1983). He was the son of Francisco Herrera Guerrero and Mar\u00eda Luisa Luque Carvallo. In 1956, he married to Maria Margarita Ter\u00e1n Austria, with whom he had five children. Herrera Luque studied in the Central University of Venezuela( UCV) and later at the University of Salamanca( 1952), where he obtained his title of physician. In Madrid he specialized in psychiatry, a field on which he wrote several scientific papers. His PhD thesis served as basis for his book:\" Los Viajeros de Indias\"( 1961), about the psychopathic loads left on the Venezuelan population by the Spanish conquistadors. His interest in understanding the origins of the personalities of Latin America people took him to the study of heritage and genetics. Herrera Luque founded the department of psychiatry of the UCV, becoming full professor. He was appointed ambassador of Venezuela in Mexico in the mid-1970s. As writer and novelist, his historical work is based on accurate and documented research. His late books:\" Los Cuatro reyes de la barajaBol\u00edvar en vivo1998\" and\" El Vuelo del Alcatraz\", were published posthumously. During the final years of his life and after his death his works gained great popularity, making him one of the best- selling writers of Venezuela. His success resulted from the combination of typical Venezuelan stories with historical facts; in his works, Herrera Luque looked beyond the official history of the country and created a parallel narrative to it. Francisco Herrera Luque died in Caracas from a heart attack on 15 April 1991. In 1992 the Francisco Herrera Luque Foundation was created. In 2010 the novel\" Boves, el Urogallo\", was adapted into a film by director Luis Alberto Lamata, with the title of\" Taita Boves\".\"",

He served briefly on the council of the Province of New York where he oversaw the trial which convicted Jacob Leisler, the ringleader of Leisler's Rebellion. He then spent eight years in England in the 1690s as Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight, including one year as a Member of Parliament for Newtown (Isle of Wight). In 1702, he returned to New England after being appointed governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and Province of New Hampshire, posts that he held until 1715. His rule of Massachusetts was characterized by hostility and tension, with political enemies opposing his attempts to gain a regular salary and regularly making complaints about his official and private actions. Most of his tenure was dominated by the French and Indian Wars, in which the two provinces were on the front lines with New France and suffered from a series of major and minor French and Indian raids. He orchestrated an unsuccessful attempt to capture the Acadian capital of Port Royal in 1707, raised provincial militia forces for its successful capture in 1710, and directed an unsuccessful expedition against Quebec in 1711. Dudley's governorship initiated a hostility in Massachusetts toward royal governance, most frequently over the issue of the salaries of crown officials. The colonial legislature routinely challenged or disputed the prerogatives of the governor, and this hostility affected most of the governors of Massachusetts up to the American Revolutionary War and the end of British rule. Dudley's rule of New Hampshire, however, was comparatively uncontroversial.\"",

In 1942 he joined Young Communist League of Yugoslavia (SKOJ) and in 1943 he went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, becoming a member of their medical units. After the war Mimica wrote literary and film reviews, and his career in filmmaking began in 1950 when he became the director of the Jadran Film production studio. He had his directorial and screenwriting debut in the 1952 Yugoslav film \" In the Storm\" (Croatian: \"U oluji\") which starred Veljko Bulaji\u0107, Mia Oremovi\u0107 and Antun Nalis. In the 1950s Mimica worked as a director and writer on a number of critically acclaimed animated films and became a prominent member of the Zagreb School of Animated Films (his 1958 animated short film \"The LonerSamac\") was awarded the Venice Grand Prix), along with authors such as Vlado Kristl and Academy Award-winning Du\u0161an Vukoti\u0107. In the 1960s Mimica moved away from animation (his last animated film was 1971 film \"The FiremenVatrogasci\")) and turned to directing feature films, starting with the 1961 Yugoslav-Italian film \"Suleiman the Conqueror\" (Italian: \"Solimano il conquistatore\") starring Edmund Purdom and Giorgia Moll. His 1965 film \"Prometheus of the IslandPrometej s otoka Vi\u0161evice\") won the Big Golden Arena for Best Film at the 1965 Pula Film Festival and earned Mimica a runner-up Silver Arena award for Best Director.

Shot in Iraqi Kurdistan, the film is co-produced Montreal \u2019s P\u00e9riph\u00e9ria Productions, Germany's MitosFilm and the National Film Board of Canada. The film was conceived and named for a woman, Gul\u00eestan, who'd been a role model for the director in her adopted home in Montreal, until she left to fight with the PKK. Ak yol went to Iraq in 2010 in an unsuccessful effort to find her and make a film about her. Unable to locate Gul\u00eestan, she did find women who knew her and the focus of the documentary shifted to telling Gul\u00eestan's story through their memories of her. But when she returned to Iraq to film in 2014, some of those women were now dead while others were in combat, and so the focus of the film shifted yet again, to documenting the experiences of women like Gul\u00eestan.\"",

From Alalakh in the west, Mitanni shared its border with Egypt in northern Syria, approximately by the river Orontes.

His surname was Doria, but since he belonged to the ruling house of Arborea he is often dynastically called Bas-Serra, or Doria-Bas. Younger brother and successor of Frederick, he was a minor upon his succession and was under the tutelage of his mother Eleanor. He was born at Castel Genovese (modern Castelsardo) between 1378 and 1379 to Eleanor and Brancaleone Doria, a Genoese nobleman. In 1383, he was proclaimed judge along with his brother, Frederick of Arborea. In 1387, his brother died under Aragonese captivity and Marianus became sole judge at a time when the Giudicato of Arborea was at war with the Crown of Aragon. On 24 January 1388, Eleanor signed a pact with Aragon which brought peace and safeguarded Marianus' rule. On 16 August 1391, Marianus accompanied his father at the occupation of Sassari and Osilo. Marianus was 14 years old in 1392 when his mother promulgated the Carta de Logu and he was declared of age. He immediately reaffirmed the treaty with Aragon, but the real power at that time lay with Brancaleone. Eleanor died in 1404. He died of bubonic plague three years later without heirs, presenting a succession crisis.\"",

He was the grandson of Beatrice, youngest daughter of Marianus IV of Arborea and Timbra de Rocabert\u00ed, and Aimery VI of Narbonne( married 1363). When Marianus V, the youngest son of Beatrice' elder sister Eleanor, died in 1407, Arborea experienced a succession crisis. The late Beatrice had a claim to the judgeship which was picked up by her grandson, son of William I. The real judge from 1407 was Leonardo Cubello, great nephew of Hugh II of Arborea. On 6 October 1408, Martin I of Sicily disembarked at Cagliari with a strong army. On 8 December, William also reached Cagliari. He was crowned\" King of Arborea, Count of Goceano, and Viscount of Bas\" at Oristano on 13 January 1409. The two forces, of Martin and of William, met at the Battle of Sanluri. The Arborean troops of William, including many Genoese crossbowmen, broke into two battles. The left battle was destroyed in a location called\" occidroxiu\"( the slaughterhouse). The right battle was broken into two part, the first was being chased to Sanluri and eventually was routed there, and the other one was forced by William to take refuge in the castle of Monreale, in the nearby village of Sardara, and continued the resistant. On 4 July, the Villa di Chiesa surrendered to Giovanni di Sena, which dealt a crippling blow to Arborea even though the Sicilian king had died on 25 July in Cagliari. William returned to France to seek aid, leaving Leonardo Cubello in charge in his absence. Leonardo successfully defended Oristano. William returned to Sardinia in Spring 1410. He reorganised his territories with his capital at Sassari. With the help of Nicol\u00f2 Doria, he recaptured Longosardo on 9 August. He tried to take Oristano and Alghero, which were defended by Peter Torrelles, who died of malaria in 1411. On 5 and 6 May 1412, he entered Alghero, but was driven off by the citizenry. With the chances of victory turned out to be grim, William reluctantly surrendered and sold Arborea to Alfonso V on 17 August 1420 for 100,000 gold florins. He was killed in 1424 in the Battle of Verneuil\"",

He was the son of Constantine I of Arborea, first ruler of Arborea of the Lacon dynasty. Married Elena de Orrubu, mother of Barison II of Arborea. The dating and chronology of his reign are obscure. Comita succeeded his father Constantine I of Arborea. The date of this succession is assumed to be 1131, when he first appears in a communication with the Republic of Genoa. In 1130, Constantine, Gonario II of Torres, and Comita I of Gallura had sworn fealty to the archbishop of Pisa. In 1133, Pope Innocent II raised Genoa to archiepiscopal status and divided the island of Sardinia between the two sees, giving the north to Genoa and the south to Pisa. In the subsequent wars of that decade, Comita was the sole ally of the Genoese. From 1133 to 1145, there is a gap in the testimony referring to Comita and it is possible that his brother Torbeno successfully usurped his throne during a war with the Giudicato of Logudoro. In 1145, Comita was back in power and was excommunicated by Baldwin, Archbishop of Pisa. The Pisan prelate, travelling the island as a papal legate, had excommunicated the judge for oppressing the people and warring against Pisa. Bernard of Clairvaux even weighed into island politics and sent a letter to Pope Eugene III to justify Baldwin's actions. Nominally Arborea was transferred to Logudoro. Comita died soon after.\"",

Cl\u00e9rico is credited with reviving the popularity of the Moulin Rouge over the course of fifty years. Cl\u00e9rico was born in Paris, France, on March 18, 1929. In 1928, his father, Joseph Cl\u00e9rico, a glassmaker, had moved to Paris from the Piedmont region with his brother, Louis Cl\u00e9rico. The brothers had opened a Parisian glass shop. Joseph and Louis made much of their family's fortune during the German occupation of Paris during World War II, when there was a shortage of glassmakers in the city. The Cl\u00e9ricos were hired to make glass for cities throughout France and Germany which had suffered bombing damage. They had both acquired considerable wealth through their repairs by the end of the war. The brothers purchased the Le Lido cabaret on the Champs- \u00c9lys\u00e9es in 1946. In 1955, Joseph and Louis purchased the Moulin Rouge. They upgraded the kitchens and marketed the venue as a tourist destination. Still, the Moulin Rouge continued to suffer from financial distress by the early 1960s. Jacki Cl\u00e9rico took over the Moulin Rouge in 1962 from his father, Joseph. Cl\u00e9rico built a new aquarium for performances, expanded the auditorium, and introduced professional theater backdrops and scenery. His first revue,\" Frou- Frou,\" opened to sold out audiences in 1963. From that point on, Jacki Cl\u00e9rico only opened revues beginning with the letter\" F\" in keeping with a superstition that the letter brought luck beginning with\" Frou- Frou\". His other revues, included\" Frisson\"( 1965),\" Fascination\"( 1967),\" Fantastic\"( 1970),\" Festival\"( 1973),\" Follement\"( 1976),\" Fr\u00e9n\u00e9sie\"( 1979),\" Femmes, Femmes, Femmes ...\"( 1983), followed this tradition. The music of these revues was composed by Henri Betti. In 1989, Clerico opened\" Formidable\" to mark the 100th anniversary of the Moulin Rouge. Guests included Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. The Moulin Rouge began to lose popularity again during the 1990s. Cl\u00e9rico continued to produce the Moulin Rouge's trademark revues, but the cabaret nearly went bankrupt in 1997. The last show that Cl\u00e9rico produced was\" F\u00e9erie\" in 1999, which featured one hundred dancers. The release of Baz Luhrmann's\" Moulin Rouge!\" in 2001, which starred Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, and Jim Broadbent, revived the club's popularity. The Moulin Rouge is now marketed as a family- oriented destination. Jacki Cl\u00e9rico turned over the day- to- day operations of the Moulin Rouge to his son, Jean- Jacques Cl\u00e9rico, during his later years. He served as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Moulin Rouge until shortly before his death. Cl\u00e9rico died on January 13, 2013, at the age of 83.\"",

He had extensive investments in railroad securities and served as a director of Wells Fargo & Company and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. Cheney was born in Boston in 1866, the eldest child of Benjamin Pierce Cheney and Elizabeth Stickney (Clapp) Cheney. His father was one of the pioneer expressmen of the United States. The younger Cheney prepared for college at English High School in Boston and with a private tutor. He received his BA degree from Harvard University in 1890. Until the death of his father in 1895 Cheney aided him in the management of his interests, which included the largest portfolio of railroad securities held in the Boston area. Upon his father's death, he was elected to succeed him as a director of Wells Fargo & Company. Having extensively studied railroad operations, Cheney was elected a director of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad and took an active part in the management of the Santa Fe system. Besides his directorships with Wells Fargo and the Santa Fe system, Cheney was a director of Manchester Mills, Manchester, Massachusetts, and of numerous Boston banks and trust companies. He also served as president of the San Diego Land & Town Company, one of his father's old ventures. At one time he was a member of the Algonquin, Union, Boston Amateur Athletic and University clubs of Boston, the Metropolitan, Players and Harvard clubs of New York City, and the University Club of San Diego California. He was married at Covington, Kentucky, on February 23, 1898, to Julia Arthur (born Ida Lewis), a noted actress. She was born at Hamilton, Ontario, on May 3, 1868, the daughter of Thomas J. Lewis, a tobacco manufacturer, and Elizabeth (Arthur) Lewis. The Cheneys made their home in Boston, with a summer estate on Calf Island. The couple were childless. In August 1899 Andrew Christeson was elected to succeed Cheney as a director of Wells Fargo. It is not said that Cheney had resigned, nor is any other information given in the meeting minutes. As a young man Cheney had taken part in amateur theatricals, and after his marriage he financed a number of professional productions, including a number that starred his wife at venues in Boston, New York City and elsewhere in the Northeast. She also appeared in ten silent films between 1908 and 1919. Her last screen performance was a benefit film to aid victims of World War I. Julia Arthur Cheney made her last Broadway performance in 1921, playing Lady Macbeth opposite Lionel Barrymore. The Cheneys were also patrons of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where they donated a number of antiquities. Cheney later suffered heavy financial reverses, and during the last years of his life he was no longer active in business. He died of thirst in the desert near Kingman, Arizona, on June 5, 1942 - ironically, alongside the tracks of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. Julia Arthur Cheney died in Boston on March 28, 1950.\"",

Bergman directed over sixty films and documentaries for cinematic release and for television screenings, most of which he also wrote. He also directed over 170 plays. He eventually forged a creative partnership with his cinematographers Gunnar Fischer and Sven Nykvist. Among his company of actors were Harriet and Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, Erland Josephson, Ingrid Thulin and Max von Sydow. Most of his films were set in Sweden, and many films from \"Through a Glass Darkly\" (1961) onward were filmed on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6.

On 1932, while in New York City, Fernando Cort\u00e9s married Puerto Rican childhood friend Mar\u00eda del Pilar Cordero, who adopted the stage name of Mapy Cort\u00e9s. The couple soon traveled to Spain with a Cuban theatrical troupe. They worked on the Spanish stage, radio and film until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936. Fernando progressively began to take a backseat as actor and baritone and focused on promoting the career of his wife Mapy, who became a noted \"vedette\" (showgirl with star status) in Barcelona. After the Spanish Civil War interrupted their careers, the couple worked in New York, San Juan, Buenos Aires, Havana and Caracas, occasionally starring in movies. They arrived to Mexico City in late 1940 and made their stage debut at the Teatro Follies, in a show headlined by the popular Mexican comedian Cantinflas. Despite early struggles to become household names, Mapy achieved Mexican film stardom in late 1941 and the couple settled in Mexico City. Initially, Fernando Cort\u00e9s played supporting roles in his wife's films. He then made a successful debut as director with \"La p\u00edcara Susana\" (1945) a comedy vehicle for his wife. On March 1954, Fernando and Mapy Cort\u00e9s returned to Puerto Rico to help launch local television. Cort\u00e9s became the first director at WKAQ-TV, Channel 2, and the couple co-starred in \"Mapy y Papi\", the first Puerto Rican sitcom. Despite their success on local TV, the couple returned the following year to Mexico City, which offered more opportunities. The couple starred in a Mexican version of their Puerto Rican sitcom and Mapy returned to the stage. Fernando Cort\u00e9s became known as a reliable director of Mexican comedies on stage, television and film. After writing and directing star vehicles for his wife Mapy in the 1940s and comedians like Resortes and Tin-Tan in the 1950s, Fernando Cort\u00e9s produced and directed Puerto Rican co-productions in the 1960s and launched the film career of La India Mar\u00eda in the 1970s.\"",

His mother was a daughter of Fujiwara no Tokihira. His elder brother from the same mother Atsutoshi died before their father's death. In 977 he became Sadaijin, and when his cousin, the regent Fujiwara no Kanemichi was in a critical medical condition, he ceded the position of Kampaku (regent) to Yoritada, instead of his rival brother Kaneie. Although Yoritada's two daughters were consorts of Emperor En'y\u016b and Emperor Kazan, they did not have any sons. Yoritada thus had only a tenable blood relationship with the Emperors. His cousin Kaneie was the grandfather of Crown Prince Yasuhito (Emperor Ichij\u014d), and he encouraged Emperor Kazan to abdicate a throne. By the accession of Emperor Ichij\u014d, Yoritada retired from his post as Kampaku, and Kaneie became Sessho (regent) for his grandson Emperor Ichij\u014d. Yoritada was Daij\u014d Daijin from 978, and he is referred to as Rengi-k\u014d (\u5ec9\u7fa9\u516c) (posthumous name of Daij\u014d Daijin).

Kint\u014d also wrote an influential critical guide to incorporating Bai Juyi's poetic techniques (and more generally, T'ang dynasty poetry) into Japanese poetry called \"Shinsen Zuin\u014d\" (\u65b0\u64b0\u9ac4\u8133) (\"The Essence of Poetry Newly Selected\").\"",

                "page_content": "\"Benjamin Pierce Cheney Jr.\tBenjamin Pierce Cheney Jr. (April 8, 1866 \u2013 June 5, 1942), was an American business executive. He had extensive investments in railroad securities and served as a director of Wells Fargo & Company and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. Cheney was born in Boston in 1866, the eldest child of Benjamin Pierce Cheney and Elizabeth Stickney (Clapp) Cheney. His father was one of the pioneer expressmen of the United States. The younger Cheney prepared for college at English High School in Boston and with a private tutor. He received his BA degree from Harvard University in 1890. Until the death of his father in 1895 Cheney aided him in the management of his interests, which included the largest portfolio of railroad securities held in the Boston area. Upon his father's death, he was elected to succeed him as a director of Wells Fargo & Company. Having extensively studied railroad operations, Cheney was elected a director of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad and took an active part in the management of the Santa Fe system. Besides his directorships with Wells Fargo and the Santa Fe system, Cheney was a director of Manchester Mills, Manchester, Massachusetts, and of numerous Boston banks and trust companies. He also served as president of the San Diego Land & Town Company, one of his father's old ventures. At one time he was a member of the Algonquin, Union, Boston Amateur Athletic and University clubs of Boston, the Metropolitan, Players and Harvard clubs of New York City, and the University Club of San Diego California. He was married at Covington, Kentucky, on February 23, 1898, to Julia Arthur (born Ida Lewis), a noted actress. She was born at Hamilton, Ontario, on May 3, 1868, the daughter of Thomas J. Lewis, a tobacco manufacturer, and Elizabeth (Arthur) Lewis. The Cheneys made their home in Boston, with a summer estate on Calf Island. The couple were childless. In August 1899 Andrew Christeson was elected to succeed Cheney as a director of Wells Fargo. It is not said that Cheney had resigned, nor is any other information given in the meeting minutes. As a young man Cheney had taken part in amateur theatricals, and after his marriage he financed a number of professional productions, including a number that starred his wife at venues in Boston, New York City and elsewhere in the Northeast. She also appeared in ten silent films between 1908 and 1919. Her last screen performance was a benefit film to aid victims of World War I. Julia Arthur Cheney made her last Broadway performance in 1921, playing Lady Macbeth opposite Lionel Barrymore. The Cheneys were also patrons of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where they donated a number of antiquities. Cheney later suffered heavy financial reverses, and during the last years of his life he was no longer active in business. He died of thirst in the desert near Kingman, Arizona, on June 5, 1942 - ironically, alongside the tracks of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. Julia Arthur Cheney died in Boston on March 28, 1950.\"",

Born into a noble family as the son of an eminent general of Empress Elizabeth's service, Aleksandr Bibikov was enrolled into the lists of the Izmaylovsky Regiment at just three years old. After his father's death on campaign in 1774, the younger Bibikov was promoted to officer status at nine years old, and by the time he was old enough to join the ranks of his regiment, he already held the rank of captain. He served in the Empress Catherine's retinue for a time, before taking part in the Russo-Swedish War, and seeing action on a number of occasions. Wounded in battle, and presented several awards, he entered the civil service during the years of peace, and was given various state and diplomatic appointments by the Emperor Paul I. After a series of brief postings to the Portuguese court and the Electorate of Saxony, he was for a time unemployed during the early reign of Emperor Alexander I, though he eventually returned to serve in various diplomatic and civil service roles. With Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, Bibikov petitioned to serve in the army once more, and was appointed to command various militias, including those of St Petersburg and Novgorod. He and his forces distinguished themselves at the Second Battle of Polotsk, and at the Battle of Smoliani, where he was wounded in the leg. Unable to ride or walk, he fought the next two battles, at Borisov and Berezina, from a sleigh, and when his horses were killed at Berezina, he leant against one of his adjutants. His forces pursued the French on their retreat from Russia, though Bibikov was forced eventually to resign due to ill health. He returned to his political duties for a time in St Petersburg, and wrote an account of his father's life and campaigns. He died in 1822 while seeking treatment abroad, and was interred in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.\"",

Dacre was the son of Sir Thomas Fiennes and Jane Sutton daughter of Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley. When his father died in 1528 he became heir apparent to his grandfather's title and the family seat at Herstmonceux Castle in Sussex, and he succeeded to the title at the age of approximately 19 in 1533. In 1536 he married Mary Neville, daughter of George Neville, 5th Baron Bergavenny. They had three children. His only sister Anne married John Mantell, who was hanged along with his brother-in-law. He was a member of the jury at the trial of Anne Boleyn in 1536, and of Thomas, Lord Darcy, and John, Lord Hussey in May 1537 (for their part in the Pilgrimage of Grace), and of Baron Montagu and the Marquess of Exeter in 1538 for the Exeter Conspiracy. On 30 April 1541 Dacre led a party of gentlemen including his brother-in-law John Mantell, John Frowds, George Roidon, Thomas Isleie, and two yeomen Richard Middleton and John Goldwell, to poach on the lands of Sir Nicholas Pelham of Laughton. During the escapade they encountered John Busbrig (or Busbridge), James Busbrig, and Richard Summer who were servants of Pelham. The encounter turned into an affray during which John Busbrig was fatally wounded. Dacre and several others were charged with murder and arraigned before the Lord High Steward, Lord Audley of Walden on 27 June. Dacre originally entered a plea of not guilty but was later persuaded to change it to guilty and throw himself upon the King's mercy in the hope of a reprieve. Unlike many of his contemporaries he was not executed by beheading but was hanged at Tyburn on 29 June 1541. An account of the execution in Hall's Chronicle says: Mantell, Frowds and Roidon were also executed for the crime. Dacre's family were stripped of their lands and title, but the title was restored to his second son Gregory in 1558 (the elder son Thomas died before the restitution, aged 15).\"",

Born in Selby, Yorkshire, England, Cawthray was a right- handed batsman, who scored 114 first- class runs at an average of 19.00, with a best of 30 against Glamorgan. He took four wickets with his right arm medium pace at 76.00 each, three of these coming in his last match against Derbyshire. He played for the Yorkshire Second XI in 1938 and 1939. He played for Brayton School from 1924 to 1927, once taking five wickets in five balls, and represented Selby Schools in the Yorkshire Shield. He played for Brayton village side from 1928, along with Cawood and Selby Londesborough, before joining Hull Cricket Club where, from 1938 to 1959, he scored 8,384 runs at 29.30, and took 872 wickets at 12.91. In 1946, he was appointed groundsman/ professional at Hull C.C., and took a similar post at Headingley in 1964. He was stated to have scored 30,000 runs, and taken 3,000 wickets during a long successful career which was interrupted by World War II, during which he was a glider pilot. Early on 19 August 1975, Cawthray discovered that campaigners calling for the release from prison of George Davis, had dug holes in the pitch and poured oil over one end of the wicket. This led to the match between England and Australia being abandoned. The match was declared a draw, denying England of the chance to win back the Ashes. He retired as groundsman at Headingley in 1978, aged 65, and died in January 2001, at the age of 87.\"",

Ye's parents died when she was a small child, leaving Ye and her four siblings in the care of her Great-Aunt. During the Cultural Revolution, Ye and her family were condemned as having \"bad blood\" and persecuted by the Communist regime, because their father had been a boss in a factory. At sixteen, like millions of other young Chinese men and women, Ye was exiled to a prison farm to \"learn from the peasants\" and be \"reformed\" by hard labor. On the farm, Ye was persecuted and suffered torture at the hands of her leaders. Ye spent six years laboring on the prison farm, before being admitted to Beijing University. She took a degree in English Literature, then began a seven-year career as English interpreter for the national government in Shanghai. During that time she met her future husband, Canadian writer and educator William E. Bell who taught English at the Foreign Affairs College in Beijing. Ye came to Canada in 1987. She published her autobiography, detailing her life in Mao's China, in 1997. She published her first picture book in 1998. Ye also writes Young Adult fiction and non-fiction.\"",

He was the eldest son of Godfrey I the Prisoner, Count of Verdun, and Matilda, daughter of Herman, Duke of Saxony, of the Billung family, a widow of Baldwin III of Flanders. Frederick was among those captured along with his father in 985 when Lothair of France attacked Verdun in 985. He was released in 987 by family ally Hugh Capet, then Duke of the Franks(\" dux et princeps Francorum\"). In 988, Frederick worked to bring the body of his brother Adalberon, Bishop of Verdun, who died in Italy, to be buried in the Verdun Cathedral. It is uncertain how long Frederic remained as Count in Verdun as the charter dated 17 Aug 1156 of Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa indicates that the County of Verdun was transferred to the Bishop of Verdun during the reign of Emperor Otto III. However, a charter dated 1020, under which Haimont, Bishop of Verdun, confirmed an exchange of property, names\" domni Frederici\u2026 comes nostre civitatis\", which suggests that Frederic continued as count at least in part of the county. A 1020 charter of Abbot Richard demonstrates that Frederick must have resigned the countship soon after, as it refers to\" temporis dominus Fredericus qui comes Virdunensis civitatis fuerat\". Frederick was also Count of Castres, as shown by the charter dated 5 May 1005 under which Henry II, then King of Germany, granted market rights at\" Doncheria \u2026 in comitatu\u2026Frederici comitis\u2026Castricensis\" to the Abbey Saint- M\u00e9dard de Soissons. It is not known who his wife or wives were. He apparently had a daughter Sophie( b. ca 1010) who married Louis II, Count of Chiny. Louis' father, a successor of Frederick \u2019s as count, was murdered by Frederick \u2019s brother Gothelo. In 1020, near the end of his life, Frederick gave up his title and became a monk at Saint- Vanne Abbey. He was succeeded as Count of Verdun by his brother Herman. It is unclear who, if anyone, succeeded him as Count of Castres.\"",

It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sinbad as two rival fathers, workaholic Howard Langston( Schwarzenegger) and stressed out postal worker Myron Larabee( Sinbad), both desperately trying to purchase a Turbo- Man action figure for their respective sons on a last- minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve. Inspired by real- life Christmas toy sell- outs for such items as Cabbage Patch Kids, the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project was picked up by 20th Century Fox. Delays to Fox's reboot of\" Planet of the Apes\" allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron. \" Jingle All the Way\" was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America. After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo- Man action figure used in the film. The film has a 16% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, citing its\" uneven tone\" that does not balance slapstick and satire well. It grossed$ 129 million worldwide, and it receives regular broadcasts on television during the Christmas season. In 2001, Fox was ordered to pay$ 19 million to Murray Hill Publishing for stealing the idea for the film; the verdict was overturned three years later. \" Jingle All the Way\" is also the third and final collaboration between Sinbad and Phil Hartman after\" Coneheads\"( 1993) and\" Houseguest\"( 1995), and the last film featuring Hartman to be released during his lifetime. Despite the negative critical reception, it is very popular during Christmas and is often shown on TV throughout the holiday season.\"",

Lady Rose Paget, as she was before her marriage, was the fourth of five daughters\u2014 her eldest sister Elizabeth and another sister, Caroline, shared the dark good looks of their mother (the former Lady Victoria Manners, eldest daughter of the 8th Duke of Rutland). Her brother was the 7th Marquess of Anglesey. Another of Paget's sisters, Mary, was brain-damaged, and Paget made herself responsible for her sister's welfare until her death in 1996. In her teens, Paget trained as a ballet dancer with Marie Rambert, and under the name Rose Bayly made her debut at Sadler's Wells in Swan Lake in 1937. After being largely educated at home, Paget led an unconventional life, being at different times a ballerina, a florist, a land girl and a countrywoman. Twice engaged to the 8th Duke of Wellington, Paget eventually married Squadron Leader The Hon. John Francis McLaren, the second son of the 2nd Baron Aberconway in 1940. He died in 1953. The McLarens had two daughters, Victoria and Harriet. In her widowhood, McLaren became friends with Muriel Belcher (founder of the club, the Colony Room) and the artist Francis Bacon. At about this time McLaren established her florist's business, which operated from the basement of her house in Chelsea. Along with Pamela Forster (the daughter of Lord Forster of Harraby and a former employee of Constance Spry), they supplied the flowers for the wedding of Princess Margaret to Antony Armstrong Jones in 1960. McLaren left London in 1975 and returned to Wales, retiring to her house on the Bodnant Estate. In later life, McLaren held several prominent positions including County chairwoman of Macmillan Nurses, president of Conwy's Churchill Club and the president of the Eglwysbach Show. McLaren died on 1 November 2005.\"",

The film gave Chan his first starring role in a widely released film( his first starring role was in the\" Little Tiger of Canton\" which only had a limited release in 1973). The film was a sequel to Bruce Lee's\" Fist of Fury\", one of Lo Wei's biggest successes.

Slovak recorded two albums with the band,\" Freaky Styley\"( 1985) and\" The Uplift Mofo Party Plan\"( 1987). His guitar work was primarily rooted in funk and hard rock, although he often experimented with other genres including reggae and speed metal. He is considered to have been a major influence on the Red Hot Chili Peppers' early sound. Born in Haifa, Israel, Slovak immigrated with his family to the United States in 1967 when he was five years old. Slovak met future bandmates Anthony Kiedis, Flea, and Jack Irons while attending high school in Los Angeles. He joined the group Anthym along with Irons while attending Fairfax High School; Flea would later join the group, which later changed its name to What Is This ?. Slovak, Flea, Kiedis, and Irons started Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1982, which became popular in the Los Angeles area, playing various shows around the city. However, Slovak quit the band to focus on What is This?, which had been signed to a record deal, leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers to record their debut album without him. He rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1985, and recorded the albums\" Freaky Styley\" and\" The Uplift Mofo Party Plan\" with the band. During his career, Slovak developed a serious heroin addiction. He attempted to quit the drug many times, but ultimately succumbed to his addiction, dying of an overdose on June 25, 1988 at age 26. He was replaced by guitarist John Frusciante, who was greatly influenced by Slovak's playing style. Several Red Hot Chili Peppers songs have been written as tributes to Slovak, including\" OthersideKnock Me Down My Lovely ManThis Is the PlaceDosed\" and\" Feasting on the Flowers\". In 1999, his brother James Slovak published a book entitled\" Behind the Sun: The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak\", which features Slovak's diaries and paintings. Slovak was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on April 14, 2012, with his brother accepting on his behalf.\"",

The monthly magazine has declared itself to be \"The Bible of the Sport.\" Bert had run the 880 yard dash in high school and continued to the cross country team at Berkeley. Returning from the Navy after World War II he first got his feet wet starting a small newspaper before the brothers began the magazine. Bert became one of the top writers of the sport. Starting in 1960 he established TAFNEWS Press, which went on to become the nation's leading track and field publisher. The company has over 100 titles. The first of those was the \"Little Red Book. \" Within the sport, the book was as important as Chairman Mao's book, but this book provided conversions between the metric system that are used in the sport worldwide and the Imperial units that are still common in America. The next book was the \"Little Gold Book\" which converted decathlon scores. Nelson was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1991.\"",

While a mathematics teacher at St. Mark's School of Texas, Macy was active in the Dallas bluegrass music scene of the 1980s, and was in a band called Danger in the Air. The band released two independent albums. With the Chicks she was the group's guitarist, co-lead singer, and occasional songwriter. Macy left the Dixie Chicks in late 1992 in a dispute with the Erwin sisters about the group's musical direction. Macy advocated for a\" purer\" bluegrass approach. ( She was not replaced; the foursome became a trio. It would be still several more years until the Dixie Chicks achieved their big commercial break, when Natalie Maines replaced Laura Lynch as lead singer.) Macy then joined Sara Hickman and Patty Lege to form the group Domestic Science Club, which issued two albums before disbanding. While still in Dallas, Macy played with an informal group named Round Robin, but she eventually moved to southern Kansas. Macy hosted an evening music show on local NPR affiliate, KERA in Dallas, in the mid-1990s. She then performed with Mark Bennett, Mike and Vicki Lynn Theobald in The Blue Plate Special. The band performed at the Walnut Valley Festival, in Winfield, Kansas in 1999. Big Twang was Macy's next project. The bluegrass quintet was founded by Macy and won the 1999 RockyGrass Band Championship. The band recorded one CD-\" Pastures of PlentyMacy \u2019s riveting, seductive voice infuses the band \u2019s renditions of Sting \u2019s' Secret Journey' and Nanci Griffith \u2019s' Time of Inconvenience' with spellbinding power and soul,\" wrote reviewer David McCarty in\" Acoustic Guitar\" magazine;\" Big Twang is one big talent.\" The band dissolved in 2003. Macy remained active in the regional music scene, and also returned to teaching mathematics. In addition, she is the steward of Bartlett Arboretum, a 501( c) 3 non-profit she created. It is located in Belle Plaine, Kansas on a slough north of the Ninnescah River drainage, 20 miles south of Wichita. She discovered the arboretum in 1997 when it was slated for sale; the owning Bartlett family viewed her arrival as a godsend. In April 2008, Macy's recording\" Songs from the Garden\", original compositions inspired from living among the trees at the arboretum, was released. The arboretum, with its application written by Macy, was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in April, 2010. In October 2008, she formed another trio with Jennifer Pettersen and Monica Taylor called The Cherokee Maidens. She is currently a teacher of geometry at Wichita Collegiate School.\"",

He was involved in the formation of the movement to stop the bombing of the island of Kahoolawe by the U.S. Navy; this was an issue which catalyzed the formation of the modern \"Hawaiian Movement\". Prejean was known for his music and \"stand-up\" comedy as well as for his unrelenting criticism of the U.S. military presence in Hawaii. It was Kawaipuna Prejean who originally proposed the convening of the 1993 Kanaka Maoli Tribunal, and other historical actions which were carried out after his death. Kawaipuna Prejean died on his 49th birthday while fighting to stop the construction of Interstate H-3, which destroyed many ancient Hawaiian sites and substantially impacted native species along its path on the island of Oahu, including several probable extinctions.\"",

The Crosby recording came about when the singer had Armstrong as a guest on his radio show which was being taped on April 19, 1951 for broadcast on April 25 that year. As was customary, the songs to be used in the broadcast were taped in advance as a back-up in case the live broadcast versions did not go well. The song was so well received that Decca Records decided to issue the pre-recording commercially and it charted briefly in June 1951 with a peak position of #19. Crosby used the song in his concert performances in 1976 singing it with comedian Ted Rogers. The duet with Louis Armstrong is still heard frequently on radio.

John represented a compensatory attitude, which strove for a , a middle way, between the two confessions during the Protestant Reformation. Despite what others may have thought, not all Germanic princely houses were Lutheran Protestant. In fact the real influence at the court of Cleves was Erasmus. Many of his men were friends and followers of this well-educated Dutch scholar and theologian. When Duke John decided to write up a list of church regulations, Erasmus was the first person the Duke went to personally for consultation and approval. Duke John had an instinct for balance as was shown when he married his eldest daughter Sybille to John Frederick of Saxony. John Frederick would go on to later head the Schmalkaldic League. In many ways John of Cleves' court was ideal for raising a Queen. It was fundamentally liberal, but serious-minded, theologically inclined, profoundly Erasmian; as the court of Catherine of Aragon had once been. It was from this court that his daughter Anne would be raised. Anne would go on to marry King Henry VIII of England as his fourth wife.\"",

He was the eldest son of Godfrey I the Prisoner, Count of Verdun, and Matilda, daughter of Herman, Duke of Saxony, of the Billung family, a widow of Baldwin III of Flanders. Frederick was among those captured along with his father in 985 when Lothair of France attacked Verdun in 985. He was released in 987 by family ally Hugh Capet, then Duke of the Franks(\" dux et princeps Francorum\"). In 988, Frederick worked to bring the body of his brother Adalberon, Bishop of Verdun, who died in Italy, to be buried in the Verdun Cathedral. It is uncertain how long Frederic remained as Count in Verdun as the charter dated 17 Aug 1156 of Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa indicates that the County of Verdun was transferred to the Bishop of Verdun during the reign of Emperor Otto III. However, a charter dated 1020, under which Haimont, Bishop of Verdun, confirmed an exchange of property, names\" domni Frederici\u2026 comes nostre civitatis\", which suggests that Frederic continued as count at least in part of the county. A 1020 charter of Abbot Richard demonstrates that Frederick must have resigned the countship soon after, as it refers to\" temporis dominus Fredericus qui comes Virdunensis civitatis fuerat\". Frederick was also Count of Castres, as shown by the charter dated 5 May 1005 under which Henry II, then King of Germany, granted market rights at\" Doncheria \u2026 in comitatu\u2026Frederici comitis\u2026Castricensis\" to the Abbey Saint- M\u00e9dard de Soissons. It is not known who his wife or wives were. He apparently had a daughter Sophie( b. ca 1010) who married Louis II, Count of Chiny. Louis' father, a successor of Frederick \u2019s as count, was murdered by Frederick \u2019s brother Gothelo. In 1020, near the end of his life, Frederick gave up his title and became a monk at Saint- Vanne Abbey. He was succeeded as Count of Verdun by his brother Herman. It is unclear who, if anyone, succeeded him as Count of Castres.\"",

When the House of Bar, which ruled in Upper Lorraine, became extinct in 1033, with the death of his cousin Frederick III, Conrad made him duke of both duchies, so that he could assist in the defence of the territory against Odo II, count of Blois, Meaux, Chartres, and Troyes( the later Champagne). In the battle at Bar on 15 November 1037, Gothelo dealt a decisive blow to Odo, who was trying to create an independent state between France and Germany. Odo died in the battle. Gothelo died on 19 April 1044 and was buried in the Abbey Church of Bilzen. His son Godfrey succeeded in Upper Lorraine, but the Emperor Henry III refused to give him the duchy of Lower Lorraine as well. When Godfrey showed disagreement with the imperial decision, Henry III threatened to pass the duchy to Godfrey's incompetent brother Gothelo. This caused a long rebellion in Lotharingia between the allies of Godfrey( the counts of Flanders and Leuven) and imperial forces( 1044 \u2013 1056).\"",

The screenplay is by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas from a story by Lucas, who was also the executive producer. It is the third installment in the original\" Star Wars\" trilogy, the third film to be produced, and sixth film in the\" Skywalker saga\". It takes place one year after\" The Empire Strikes Back\". The film stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew and Frank Oz. In the film, the Galactic Empire, under the direction of the ruthless Emperor, is constructing a second Death Star in order to crush the Rebel Alliance once and for all. Since the Emperor plans to personally oversee the final stages of its construction, the Rebel Fleet launches a full- scale attack on the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill the Emperor, effectively bringing an end to his hold over the galaxy. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker struggles to bring his father Darth Vader back to the light side of the Force. Steven Spielberg, David Lynch and David Cronenberg were considered to direct the project before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas' storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow Industrial Light& Magic more time to work on the film's effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to. Strict secrecy surrounded the production. The film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983, six years to the day of the release of the first film, receiving mostly positive reviews. It grossed$ 475 million worldwide, becoming the highest- grossing film of 1983. Several re-releases and revisions to the film have followed over the decades.\"",

He was the only son of Louis, Prince of Piacenza, and his wife Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain. Born at the Royal Palace of Madrid at the court of his maternal grandfather King Charles IV of Spain, he spent his first years living at the Spanish court. In 1801, by the Treaty of Aranjuez, Charles became Crown Prince of Etruria, a newly created kingdom formed from territories of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Charles moved to Italy with his parents and in 1803, not yet four years old, he succeeded his father as King of Etruria under the name Charles Louis I. His mother Infanta Maria Luisa assumed the regency while Charles Louis' minority lasted. In 1807 Napoleon Bonaparte dissolved the kingdom of Etruria and Charles Louis and his mother took refuge in Spain. In May 1808 they were forced to leave Spain by Napoleon who arrested Charles Louis' mother in a convent in Rome. Between 1811 and 1814 Charles Louis was placed under the care of his grandfather, the deposed King Charles IV of Spain. After Napoleon's fall, in 1817, Infanta Maria Luisa became Duchess of Lucca in her own right and Charles Louis, age sixteen, became hereditary Prince of Lucca. In 1820 he married Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy. They were a mismatched couple and had only one surviving son. At his mother's death in 1824, Charles Louis became the reigning Duke of Lucca as Charles I. He had little interest in ruling. He left the duchy in the hands of his ministers and spent most of his time traveling around Europe. A liberal movement led him to abdicate Lucca in favor of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in October 1847 in exchange for financial compensation, as he wanted to retire to private life. Two months later, in December 1847, at the death of the former Empress Marie Louise, he succeeded her as the reigning Duke of Parma according to what had been stipulated by the Congress of Vienna. His reign in Parma as Duke Charles II was brief. He was ill- received by his new subjects and within a few months he was ousted by a revolution. He regained control of Parma under the protection of Austrian troops, but finally abdicated in favor of his son Charles III on 14 March 1849. His son was assassinated in 1854 and his grandson Robert I, the last reigning Duke of Parma, was deposed in 1860. In exile Charles Louis assumed the title of count of Villafranca. He spent the last years of his life mostly in France, dying at Nice on 16 April 1883.\"",

It is perhaps best known for starting the\" cannibal boom\" of Italian exploitation cinema during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Lenzi was probably trying to imitate the content of notorious Mondo cinema, which had gained considerable Grindhouse popularity since Gualtiero Jacopetti and Paolo Cavara made\" Mondo Cane\" in 1962, even though this film is fictional. Like\" Man from Deep River\", Mondo films often focus on exotic customs and locations, graphic violence, and animal cruelty. The film was mainly inspired by\" A Man Called Horse\", which also featured a white man who is incorporated into a tribe that originally held him captive.

He directed classic films from the silent era and numerous others during Hollywood's Golden Age, when the studio system was prevalent. Curtiz was already a well-known director in Europe when Warner Bros. invited him to Hollywood in 1926, when he was 39 years of age. He had already directed 64 films in Europe, and soon helped Warner Bros. become the fastest-growing movie studio. He directed 102 films during his Hollywood career, mostly at Warners, where he directed ten actors to Oscar nominations. James Cagney and Joan Crawford won their only Academy Awards under Curtiz's direction. He put Doris Day and John Garfield on screen for the first time, and he made stars of Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Bette Davis. He himself was nominated five times and won twice, once for Best Short Subject for \"Sons of Liberty\" and once as Best Director for \"Casablanca\". Curtiz introduced to Hollywood a unique visual style using artistic lighting, extensive and fluid camera movement, high crane shots, and unusual camera angles. He was versatile and could handle any kind of picture: melodrama, comedy, love story, film noir, musical, war story, Western, or historical epic. He always paid attention to the human-interest aspect of every story, stating that the \"human and fundamental problems of real people\" were the basis of all good drama. Curtiz helped popularize the classic swashbuckler with films such as \"Captain Blood\" (1935) and \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938). He directed many dramas which today are also considered classics, \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" (1938), \"The Sea Wolf\" (1941), \"Casablanca\" (1942), and \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945). He directed leading musicals, including \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (1942), \" This Is the Army\" (1943), and \"White Christmas\", and he made comedies with \"Life With Father\" (1947) and \"We're No Angels\" (1955).\"",

Starring Parker, Stone, Kristen Miller, Masasa Moyo, Daran Norris, Phil Hendrie, Maurice LaMarche, Chelsea Marguerite, Jeremy Shada and Fred Tatasciore , the film is a satire of big-budget action films and their associated clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, with particular humorous emphasis on the global implications of the politics of the United States. The title is derived from domestic and international political criticisms that the foreign policy of the United States frequently and unilaterally tries to \"police the worldTeam America\" follows the fictional titular paramilitary police force and their recruitment of a Broadway actor in an attempt to save the world from Kim Jong-il, who is leading a conspiracy of Islamic terrorists and liberal Hollywood actors in a bid for global destruction. Instead of live actors, the film uses a style of puppetry based on Supermarionation, known for its use in the British TV series \"Thunderbirds\", although Stone and Parker were not fans of that show. The duo worked on the script with former \"South Park\" writer Brady for nearly two years. The film had a troubled time in production, with various problems regarding the marionettes, as well as the scheduling extremes of having the film come out in time. In addition, the filmmakers fought with the Motion Picture Association of America, who returned the film over nine times with an NC-17 rating due to an explicit sex scene in the film. The film was cut by less than a minute and rated R for \"graphic crude and sexual humor, violent images and strong language \u2013 all involving puppets\". The film premiered at the Denver Film Festival on October 14, 2004, and was released theatrically in the United States the following day on October 15, 2004 by Paramount Pictures. It has received mostly positive reviews from critics and grossed over $51 million worldwide against its $32 million budget.\"",

Born in Bucharest, his parents were the poet Ioan S. Neni\u021bescu and his wife Elena (\"n\u00e9e\" \u0218tefan). He attended Sapienza University of Rome from 1920, as well as the literature and philosophy department of Bucharest University. At first an assistant professor of aesthetics, he later became an associate professor at Bucharest. He served as press secretary and later economic adviser to the Romanian legation in The Hague. Neni\u021bescu's first publication was a 1915 article about William Shakespeare that appeared in \"Noua revist\u0103 rom\u00e2n\u0103\". His first book of poetry, \"Denii\" (1919), was followed by \"Vraj\u0103\" (1923) and \"Ode italice\" (1925). His single volume of theatre was \"Trei mistere\" (1922). From 1924, he wrote for \"G\u00e2ndirea\", and was a founding member of Romania's PEN Club. He also contributed poetry and art criticism to \"Convorbiri LiterareIdeea european\u0103VremeaUniversul literarVia\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103Adev\u0103rul\" and \"Arta plastic\u0103\". In 1925, Neni\u021bescu published a treatise, \"Istoria artei ca filosofie a istoriei\". He translated from Benedetto Croce (\"Aesthetic\", 1922) and Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli (\"The Mandrake\", 1926). Initially, Neni\u021bescu's poetry was discursive and religious, in line with the \"G\u00e2ndirist\" current. His verse became progressively more hermetic, as can be seen in the anthology volume \"Ani\" (1973). Including texts published in the 1940s and '50s, it reveals the intellectualized lyric verse of an eminently classical nature.\"",

Born in New York City, he emigrated to Israel with his family at the age of four, in 1971. He was a young Israeli Orthodox Jewish scholar and rabbi who was most famous for his leadership of Kahane Chai, a far-right political party that broke from his father's Kach party after Meir Kahane's assassination in 1990. He was convicted several times by Israeli courts for advocating violence against Arabs. Kahane was the author of \"The Haggada of the Jewish Idea\", a commentary based on his father's teachings of the Passover Haggadah read at the Passover Seder. He wrote a Torah portion sheet called \"Darka Shel TorahThe Way of the Torah\") that was distributed for the weekly Torah portions. He and his wife Talya were shot and killed near the Israeli settlement of Ofra on 31 December 2000. The ambush took place on road 60 about 15 KM north of Jerusalem, just before the town of Ofra. Five of the couple's six children were in the van when they were hit by automatic rifle fire. Binyamin (the driver) was killed, and the vehicle lost control and smashed into a wall. His wife Taliya died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital in Jerusalem. The Prime Minister's Office subsequently announced the arrest of three members of Force 17 \u2013 Talal Ghassan, Marzouk Abu Naim, and Na'man Nofel \u2013 who were believed to have carried out the attack under the instruction of PLO leader Col.

His legacy continues to influence militant and far-right political groups active today in Israel. Kahane publicized his \"Kahanism\" ideology, which he claimed was simply Torah Judaism based on \"halakha\" (Jewish law), through published works, weekly articles, speeches, debates on college campuses and in synagogues throughout the United States, and appearances on various televised programs and radio shows. He was an intense advocate for Jewish causes, such as organizing defense squads and patrols in Jewish neighborhoods and demanding for the Soviet Union to \"release its oppressed Jews\". He supported violence against those he regarded as enemies of the Jewish people, called for immediate Jewish mass migration to Israel to avoid a potential \"Holocaust\" in the United States, supported the restriction of Israel's democracy to its Jewish citizens, hoped that Israel would eventually adopt \"halakha\", and endorsed the annexation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Kahane proposed enforcing \"halakha\" as codified by Maimonides. Non-Jews wishing to dwell in Israel would have three options: remain as \"resident strangers\" with limited rights, leave Israel and receive compensation for their property, or be forcibly removed without compensation. While serving in the Knesset in the mid-1980s Kahane proposed numerous laws, none of which passed, to emphasize Judaism in public schools, reduce Israel's bureaucracy, forbid sexual relations between non-Jews and Jews, and end cultural meetings between Jewish and Arab students. In 1968, Kahane was one of the co-founders of the Jewish Defense League (JDL) in the United States. In 1971, he co-founded Kach (\"Thus\"), a new political party in Israel. The same year, he was convicted in New York for conspiracy to manufacture explosives and received a suspended sentence of five years. In 1984, he became a member of the Knesset, when Kach gained its only-ever seat in parliamentary elections. In 1988, after polls showed Kach gaining popularity, the Israeli government banned Kach for being \"racist\" and \"anti-democratic\" under the terms of a law that it had just passed. Kahane was assassinated in a Manhattan hotel by an Egyptian-born U.S. citizen in November 1990.\"",

He reigned from 976 to his death in 997. He was a younger brother of his predecessor Emperor Taizu, and the father of his successor Emperor Zhenzong. Why Emperor Taizong succeeded his brother rather than Emperor Taizu's grown sons (Zhao Dezhao and Zhao Defang, who both died in their twenties during his reign) is not entirely understood by later historians. According to official history, his succession was confirmed by Emperor Taizu on their mother Empress Dowager Du's deathbed as a result of her instruction. A popular story dating back from at least the 11th century suggests that Emperor Taizong murdered his brother in the dim candlelight when the sound of an axe was allegedly heard. Whatever the truth, Zhao Guangyi had been prefect of the Song capital Kaifeng since 961 where he gradually consolidated power. He was the only living prince during Emperor Taizu's reign (as Prince of Jin) and placed above all grand councilors in regular audiences. In the first three years of his reign, he intimidated the Qingyuan warlord Chen Hongjin and Wuyue king Qian Chu into submission and easily conquered Northern Han, thus reunifying China Proper for the first time in 72 years. However, subsequent irredentist wars to conquer former Tang dynasty territories from the Liao dynasty in the north and the Early L\u00ea dynasty in the southwest proved disastrous: after the failures in the Battle of Gaoliang River and the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng, the Sixteen Prefectures and Northern Vietnam (at least in their entirety) would remain beyond Chinese control until the Ming dynasty in the 14th century. Emperor Taizong is remembered as a hardworking and diligent emperor. He paid great attention to the welfare of his people and made the Song Empire more prosperous. He adopted the centralization policies of the Later Zhou, which include increasing agricultural production, broadening the imperial examination system, compiling encyclopaedias, expanding the civil service and further limiting the power of \"jiedushis\". All subsequent emperors of the Northern Song were his descendants, as well as the first emperor of the Southern Song. However, from Emperor Xiaozong onwards, subsequent emperors were descendants of his brother, Emperor Taizu. This largely stemmed from the Jingkang Incident, whereby most of Emperor Taizong's descendants were abducted by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, forcing Emperor Gaozong to seek a successor among Taizu's descendants, as Gaozong's only son had died young.\"",

Historians have generally viewed Emperor Gaozong as a weak ruler, inattentive to the business of the state and leaving such business to his powerful wife Empress Wu. During the first part of his reign, Tang territorial gains, which started with his father Emperor Taizong, continued, including the conquest of Baekje, Goguryeo, and the Western Turkic Khaganate, but throughout the 670s, much of those gains were lost to the Tibetan Empire, Silla, Khitan, and Balhae.

As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous music genres, he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century. His works include such widely heard pieces as the March from \"The Love for Three Oranges,\" the suite \"Lieutenant Kij\u00e9\", the ballet \"Romeo and Juliet\"\u2014from which \"Dance of the Knights\" is taken\u2014and \"Peter and the Wolf. \" Of the established forms and genres in which he worked, he created \u2013 excluding juvenilia \u2013 seven completed operas, seven symphonies, eight ballets, five piano concertos, two violin concertos, a cello concerto, a symphony-concerto for cello and orchestra, and nine completed piano sonatas. A graduate of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety with a series of ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos. In 1915, Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral \"Scythian Suite\", compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev\u2014\"Chout,Le pas d'acier\" and \"The Prodigal Son\"\u2014which at the time of their original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues. Prokofiev's greatest interest, however, was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including \"The Gambler\" and \"The Fiery Angel\". Prokofiev's one operatic success during his lifetime was \"The Love for Three Oranges\", composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia. After the Revolution of 1917, Prokofiev left Russia with the official blessing of the Soviet minister Anatoly Lunacharsky, and resided in the United States, then Germany, then Paris, making his living as a composer, pianist and conductor. During that time, he married a Spanish singer, Carolina (Lina) Codina, with whom he had two sons. In the early 1930s, the Great Depression diminished opportunities for Prokofiev's ballets and operas to be staged in America and western Europe. Prokofiev, who regarded himself as composer foremost, resented the time taken by touring as a pianist, and increasingly turned to the Soviet Union for commissions of new music; in 1936, he finally returned to his homeland with his family. He enjoyed some success there \u2013 notably with \"Lieutenant Kij\u00e9,Peter and the Wolf,Romeo and Juliet,\" and perhaps above all with \"Alexander Nevsky.\" The Nazi invasion of the USSR spurred him to compose his most ambitious work, an operatic version of Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\". In 1948, Prokofiev was attacked for producing \"anti-democratic formalism. \" Nevertheless, he enjoyed personal and artistic support from a new generation of Russian performers, notably Sviatoslav Richter and Mstislav Rostropovich: he wrote his ninth piano sonata for the former and his Symphony-Concerto for the latter.\"",

It stars Henry Fonda, cast against type, as the villain, Charles Bronson as his nemesis, Claudia Cardinale as a newly widowed homesteader, and Jason Robards as a bandit. The screenplay was written by Sergio Donati and Leone, from a story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci and Leone. The widescreen cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the acclaimed film score was by Ennio Morricone. After directing\" The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", Leone decided to retire from Westerns and desired to produce his film based on\" The Hoods\", which eventually became\" Once Upon a Time in America\". However, Leone accepted an offer from Paramount Pictures to provide access to Henry Fonda and to use a budget to produce another Western film. He recruited Bertolucci and Argento to devise the plot of the film in 1966, researching other Western films in the process. After Clint Eastwood turned down an offer to play the movie's protagonist, Bronson was offered the role. During production, Leone recruited Donati to rewrite the script due to concerns over time limitations. The original version by the director was 166 minutes( 2 hours and 46 minutes) when it was first released on 21 December 1968. This was the version that was to be shown in European cinemas and was a box office success. For the US release on 28 May 1969,\" Once Upon a Time in the West\" was edited down to 145 minutes( 2 hours and 25 minutes) by Paramount and was a financial flop. The film is the first installment in Leone's\" Once Upon a Time Trilogy\", followed by\" Duck, You Sucker!\" and\" Once Upon a Time in America\", though the films do not share any characters in common. In 2009, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being\" culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\"",

He won scholarships to Upper Canada College( graduating in 1926) and Trinity College, Toronto( class of 1930) where he majored in German and played ice hockey, football, and cricket. He was a member of the Beta Psi fraternity. He was offered a contract with the Montreal Maroons ice hockey team but decided to continue his studies instead. He was selected as a Rhodes Scholar and continued Germanic studies at Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating in 1932. While there he was captain of the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club that won the Spengler Cup two years in a row. On his return to Canada, he married Ruth B. Harrison of Rothesay, New Brunswick. He taught at Upper Canada College until he joined the Royal Canadian Navy at the outbreak of the war in 1939. Little presented himself at HMCS York in Toronto, but after he mentioned that he was a teacher of German and that he had just returned from a trip to Germany, he was immediately sent to Ottawa. Upon his arrival he was asked to go through some captured German documents, some of which seemed to describe a weapon. Those papers were sent to London and were found to be partial plans for the new magnetic mines being used by the German Navy. During the war he served as Director of Naval Intelligence on the Naval Staff. Because of his position he was one of the few Canadians to handle Ultra decrypts. After the defeat of Nazi Germany he was allowed to enter combat and was sent to join the British Pacific Fleet. He remained in the Navy until 1959, helping to develop the University Naval Training Division and the Regular Officer Training Plan. After leaving the Navy he became a federal civil servant. From 1964 to 1971 he was Chief Editor of the Royal Commission on Pilotage. He wrote ten historical books, a book of poetry and numerous articles. He was a lifelong contributor to the Royal Canadian Geographical Society Journal. He was made a fellow of the society in 1969( FRCGS). He was given an award by the Spanish government for his history of Spanish exploration of the west coast of Canada. He was National President of the Canadian Authors' Association from 1972 to 1975 and was made Honorary President in 2001. He was president of the Canadian Writers' Foundation from 1978 to 2001 and was Honorary President thereafter. In 1977 he was awarded the Queen's Jubilee Medal. In 1991 he was awarded the Admirals' Medal. In 2000 at the age of 92, he dropped the puck at the start of the 100th annual Oxford vs Cambridge Ice Hockey game. He died in Ottawa at the age of 96.

He was the son of Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox, and his wife Katherine Clifton, 2nd Baroness Clifton, and the brother of James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond and 4th Duke of Lennox, and of the Royalist commander Lord Bernard Stewart. Stewart, his older brother Henry, and younger brother Ludovic were brought up at Aubigny in France as Roman Catholics under the charge of their paternal grandmother, the old Duchess-Dowager, Katherine de Balsac. Stewart's father, the Duke of Lennox, died in 1624, and Stewart became a ward of his cousin, King Charles I of England. He inherited the Lordship of Aubigny at the age of 14 on the death of his elder brother Henry in 1632. By 1633, he was a student at the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre, part of the University of Paris, and he did homage to Louis XIII of France for the lordship of Aubigny on 5 August 1636, shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Later that year he moved to England. In 1638 he secretly married Katherine Howard, the daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, and Elizabeth Home, without her father's consent, offending his guardian the king. The portrait of Stewart by Anthony van Dyck, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, may have been painted to mark his marriage; the Latin inscription can be translated \"Love is stronger than I am\" which may allude to his conflicting loyalties. His younger brothers Lords John and Bernard are shown in a still more famous double Van Dyck portrait in the National Gallery, London - the iconic image of Cavaliers. They were also both killed in the Civil War. George Stewart and Katherine Howard had two children: He fought with the French against the Spanish in the Battle of Montju\u00efc (1641). As civil war loomed in England, Stewart joined the forces of King Charles at York where he was knighted on 18 April 1642 along with his brother Bernard. He was mortally wounded in the first pitched battle of the war at Edgehill on Sunday 23 October 1642, aged 24. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The lordship of Aubigny passed to his next brother, Ludovic, on his death. His widow remarried James Levingston, 1st Earl of Newburgh and had one further child Elizabeth. They were suspected in 1648 of plotting to rescue Charles I and on the discovery of the supposed plot fled to the Netherlands where Katherine died in 1650.\"",

He was the grandson of Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox.

In January 1658, Charles Stewart went into exile in France, and took up his residence in the house of his uncle, Ludovic, seigneur d'Aubigny. In the following year he fell under the displeasure of The Protectorate's Council of State, and warrants were issued for seizing his person and goods. Charles Stewart married, firstly, Elizabeth Rogers, after June 1659. He married, secondly, Margaret Banaster (widow of William Lewis) on 31 March 1662. He married, thirdly, Frances Teresa Stewart, granddaughter of Walter Stewart, 1st Lord Blantyre, in March 1667. This last marriage was famous, as Frances Stewart, known at court as \"Le Belle Stuart\" had been desired by Richmond's cousin, King Charles II, as a mistress. Charles Stewart returned to England with Charles II in 1660, and sat in the Convention Parliament, showing great animosity towards the supporters of the Commonwealth. On the death of his 10-year-old cousin Esm\u00e9 Stewart on 10 August 1660, Charles Stewart succeeded as third Duke of Richmond and sixth Duke of Lennox. In that same year he was created Hereditary Great Chamberlain of Scotland, Hereditary Great Admiral of Scotland, and Lord-Lieutenant of Dorset. On 15 April 1661 he was invested with the Order of the Garter. On the death of his uncle, Ludovic Stuart, he succeeded him as 12th Seigneur D'Aubigny, for which title he did homage by proxy to Louis XIV of France on 11 May 1670. In July 1667, on the death of his cousin, Mary Butler, countess of Arran, he became Baron Clifton, and on 4 May 1668 he was made lord lieutenant and vice admiral of Kent jointly with the Earl of Winchilsea. In 1671 he was sent as ambassador to the Danish court to persuade Denmark to join England and France in a projected attack on the Dutch. While there he died (by drowning) in 1672, aged 33 at Elsinore, without issue, and his titles became extinct, with the exception of Baron Clifton, which passed with most of his property to his sister Katherine, Lady O'Brien. His wife, however, had had the Lennox estates granted to her for life. He was buried on 20 September 1673 at Westminster Abbey. The titles Duke of Richmond, Duke of Lennox and Earl of March, were resurrected for Charles II's illegitimate son by Louise de K\u00e9rouaille, Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond and Lennox, in 1675.\"",

On 1932, while in New York City, Fernando Cort\u00e9s married Puerto Rican childhood friend Mar\u00eda del Pilar Cordero, who adopted the stage name of Mapy Cort\u00e9s. The couple soon traveled to Spain with a Cuban theatrical troupe. They worked on the Spanish stage, radio and film until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936. Fernando progressively began to take a backseat as actor and baritone and focused on promoting the career of his wife Mapy, who became a noted \"vedette\" (showgirl with star status) in Barcelona. After the Spanish Civil War interrupted their careers, the couple worked in New York, San Juan, Buenos Aires, Havana and Caracas, occasionally starring in movies. They arrived to Mexico City in late 1940 and made their stage debut at the Teatro Follies, in a show headlined by the popular Mexican comedian Cantinflas. Despite early struggles to become household names, Mapy achieved Mexican film stardom in late 1941 and the couple settled in Mexico City. Initially, Fernando Cort\u00e9s played supporting roles in his wife's films. He then made a successful debut as director with \"La p\u00edcara Susana\" (1945) a comedy vehicle for his wife. On March 1954, Fernando and Mapy Cort\u00e9s returned to Puerto Rico to help launch local television. Cort\u00e9s became the first director at WKAQ-TV, Channel 2, and the couple co-starred in \"Mapy y Papi\", the first Puerto Rican sitcom. Despite their success on local TV, the couple returned the following year to Mexico City, which offered more opportunities. The couple starred in a Mexican version of their Puerto Rican sitcom and Mapy returned to the stage. Fernando Cort\u00e9s became known as a reliable director of Mexican comedies on stage, television and film. After writing and directing star vehicles for his wife Mapy in the 1940s and comedians like Resortes and Tin-Tan in the 1950s, Fernando Cort\u00e9s produced and directed Puerto Rican co-productions in the 1960s and launched the film career of La India Mar\u00eda in the 1970s.\"",

He married Elena Calvo Cruchaga in 1877. Manuel Bulnes was elected a deputy for Mulch\u00e9n in 1879. At the beginning of the War of the Pacific, he organized a cavalry squadron that they named \"Escuadr\u00f3n de Carabineros de Yungay\", but the transport \"Rimac\" where they were traveling to the theater of operations was captured en route by the Peruvian Navy and they were interned as prisoners of war in the city of Tarma.

After the war, he went in a government commission to Europe, where he was during the 1891 Chilean Civil War. He supported the congressional side and was rewarded with the promotion to Brigade General. He returned to Chile in 1894, where he became Secretary and later Chief of the Army General Staff.

Juan Carlos is the grandson of Alfonso XIII, the last king of Spain before the abolition of the monarchy in 1931 and the subsequent declaration of the Second Spanish Republic. Juan Carlos was born in Rome, Italy, during his family's exile. \" General\u00edsimo\" Francisco Franco took over the government of Spain after his victory in the Spanish Civil War in 1939, yet in 1947 Spain's status as a monarchy was affirmed and a law was passed allowing Franco to choose his successor. Juan Carlos's father, Juan, was the third son of King Alfonso, who had renounced his claims to the throne in January 1941. Juan was seen by Franco to be too liberal and in 1969 was bypassed in favour of Juan Carlos as Franco's successor as head of state. Juan Carlos spent his early years in Italy and came to Spain in 1947 to continue his studies. After completing his secondary education in 1955, he began his military training and entered the General Military Academy at Zaragoza. Later, he attended the Naval Military School, the General Academy of the Air, and finished his tertiary education at the University of Madrid. In 1962, Juan Carlos married Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark in Athens. The couple had two daughters and a son together: Elena, Cristina, and Felipe. Due to Franco's declining health, Juan Carlos first began periodically acting as Spain's head of state in the summer of 1974. Franco died in November the following year and Juan Carlos became king on 22 November 1975, two days after Franco's death, the first reigning monarch since 1931; although his exiled father did not formally renounce his claims to the throne in favor of his son until 1977. Expected to continue Franco's legacy, Juan Carlos, however, soon after his accession introduced reforms to dismantle the Francoist regime and begin the Spanish transition to democracy. This led to the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 in a referendum, which re-established a constitutional monarchy. In 1981, Juan Carlos played a major role in preventing a coup that attempted to revert Spain to Francoist government in the King's name. In 2008, he was considered the most popular leader in all Ibero- America. Hailed for his role in Spain's transition to democracy, the King and the monarchy's reputation began to suffer after controversies surrounding his family arose, exacerbated by an elephant- hunting trip he undertook during a time of financial crisis in Spain. In 2014, Juan Carlos, citing personal reasons, abdicated in favour of his son, who acceded to the throne as Felipe VI.\"",

Larry Richardson began his bluegrass career with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers alongside mandolin player Bobby Osborne of Osborne Brothers fame.

After Larry's brief time with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, he joined Bill Monroe as a banjo player from 1950-1951. He never made a recording as a \"Bluegrass Boy\". Larry then went on to work for Carl and J.P. Sauceman who ran a bluegrass show on WREN (AM). In 1956, Larry was featured on a record that changed the way many people hear and play the banjo. American Banjo Scruggs Style which showcased the many banjo players who had adopted Earl Scruggs' famous \"three finger roll\" style of picking. On the record, Richardson played a rousing and inventive version of \"Little Maggie\" that influenced any number of up-and-coming banjo players in the late 1950s. Soon after the release of this record, Larry relocated to Low Gap, North Carolina. From the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s Larry recorded with the Blue Ridge Boys who focused on a traditional bluegrass sound. In the latter 30 years of his life, Larry became an evangelist and spent the rest of his life preaching and singing bluegrass gospel.

Anger created two other versions of this film in 1966 and the late 1970s. According to him, the film takes the name\" pleasure dome\" from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's atmospheric poem\" Kubla Khan\". Anger was inspired to make the film after attending a Halloween party called\" Come as your Madness\". The film has gained cult film status. Earlier prints of the film had sequences that were meant to be projected on three different screens, an idea inspired in part by Abel Gance's Napol\u00e9on( 1927 film). The three- screen version was shown at the Brussels World's Fair. Anger subsequently re-edited the film to layer the images. The film( primarily in the second or third version) was often shown in American universities and art galleries during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The original edition soundtrack is a complete performance of\" Glagolitic Mass\" by the Czech composer Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek( 1854 \u2013 1928). In 1966, a re-edited version known as' The Sacred Mushroom Edition' was made available. In the late 1970s, a third revision was made, which was' The Sacred Mushroom Edition' re-edited to fit the Electric Light Orchestra album\" Eldorado\", omitting only\" Illusions in G Major\", a blues- rock tune that Anger felt did not fit the mood of the film. The differences in the visuals of the 1954 original and the two revisions are minor. An early version \u2014shown only once on German television in the early 1980s, and held to this day by NDR\u2014includes an additional three minutes at the beginning, including a reading of the poem\" Kubla Khan\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The film reflects Anger's deep interest in Thelema, the philosophy of Aleister Crowley and his followers, as indicated by Marjorie Cameron's role as\" The Scarlet Woman\"( an honorific Crowley bestowed on certain of his important magical partners). Crowley's concept of a ritual masquerade party where attendees dress as gods and goddesses served as a direct inspiration for the film. The film uses some footage of the Hell sequence from the 1911 Italian silent film\" L'Inferno\". Near the end, scenes from Anger's earlier film\" Puce Moment\" are interpolated into the layered images and faces.\"",

Before he became Prince of Orange upon the death of his eldest half-brother Philip William in 1618, he was known as Maurice of Nassau. Maurice spent his youth in Dillenburg in Nassau, and studied in Heidelberg and Leiden. He succeeded his father William the Silent as stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland in 1585, and became stadtholder of Utrecht, Guelders and Overijssel in 1590, and of Groningen in 1620. As Captain-General and Admiral of the Union, Maurice organised the Dutch rebellion against Spain into a coherent, successful revolt and won fame as a military strategist. Under his leadership and in cooperation with the Land's Advocate of Holland Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, the Dutch States Army achieved many victories and drove the Spaniards out of the north and east of the Republic. Maurice set out to revive and revise the classical doctrines of Vegetius and pioneered the new European forms of armament and drill. During the Twelve Years' Truce, a religious dispute broke out in the Republic, and a conflict erupted between Maurice and Van Oldenbarnevelt, which ended with the latter's decapitation. After the Truce, Maurice failed to achieve more military victories. He died without legitimate children in The Hague in 1625, and was succeeded by his younger half-brother Frederick Henry.\"",

Ismail I wanted to use prince Murad to mobilize opposition against Selim I. In 1512, during Nur-Ali Khalifa's large-scale campaign in Anatolia, Murad joined his campaign, and even \"girded the Qizilbash crown\". According to information Selim I received from his spies (December 1512/January 1513), Ismail I allegedly wanted to conquer Anatolia, give the Rum beylerbeylik to Murad, while the rest of the territory would be ruled by the Qizilbash. Anyhow, when the Safavid support meant for Murad failed to materialize, the scheme was abandoned, and Murad migrated to the Safavid Empire where he was given asylum. He died at Kashan, or Isfahan.

He was the first Ottoman Sultan who travelled to Western Europe, visiting a number of important European capitals including Paris, London and Vienna in the summer of 1867. Apart from his passion for the Ottoman Navy, which had the world's third largest fleet in 1875 (after the British and French navies), the Sultan took an interest in documenting the Ottoman Empire. He was also interested in literature and was a talented classical music composer. Some of his compositions, together with those of the other members of the Ottoman dynasty, have been collected in the album \"European Music at the Ottoman Court\" by the London Academy of Ottoman Court Music. He was deposed on grounds of mismanaging the Ottoman economy on 30 May 1876, and was found dead six days later under unnatural and mysterious circumstances.\"",

Atang de la Rama was born in Pandacan, Manila on January 11, 1902. By the age of 7, she was already starring in Spanish \"zarzuelas\" such as \"MascotaSue\u00f1o de un Vals\", and \"Marina\". At the age of 15, she starred in the sarsuela \"Dalagang Bukid\", where she became known for singing the song, \"Nabasag na Banga\". During the American occupation of the Philippines, Atang de la Rama fought for the dominance of the \"kundiman\", an important Philippine folk song, and the \"sarsuela\", which is a musical play that focused on contemporary Filipino issues such as usury, cockfighting, and colonial mentality. Generations of Filipino artists and audiences consider Atang de la Rama's vocal and acting talents as responsible for much of the success of original Filipino sarsuelas like \"Dalagang Bukid\", and dramas like \"Veronidia\". She has also been a theatrical producer, writer and talent manager. She was the producer and the writer of plays such as \"Anak ni Eva\" and \"Bulaklak ng Kabundukan\". For her achievements and contributions to the art form, she was hailed Queen of the Kundiman and of the Sarsuela in 1979, at the age of 74. Atang believed that art should be for everyone; not only did she perform in major Manila theaters such as the \"Teatro Libertad\" and the \"Teatro Zorilla\", but also in cockpits and open plazas in Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. She also made an effort to bring the kundiman and sarsuela to the indigenous peoples of the Philippine such as the Igorots, the Aetas, and the Mangyans. She was also at the forefront of introducing Filipino culture to foreign audiences. At the height of her career, she sang kundimans and other Filipino songs in concerts in such cities as Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo. On May 8, 1987, \"for her sincere devotion to original Filipino theater and music, her outstanding artistry as singer, and as sarsuela actress-playwright-producer, her tireless efforts to bring her art to all sectors of Filipino society and to the world,\" President Corazon C. Aquino proclaimed Atang de la Rama a National Artist of the Philippines for Theater and Music. Atang de la Rama died on July 11, 1991. She was married to National Artist for Literature, Amado V. Hernandez.\"",

Sullivan won the seat of Longman for the Labor Party from the Liberal Party at the 2007 federal election. Sullivan defeated government minister Mal Brough. It was one of a number of Labor gains at that election which propelled the party from opposition to government. However, the seat was returned to the Liberal National Party of Queensland at the 2010 election, when Sullivan was defeated by 20- year- old candidate, Wyatt Roy. In the closing week of the 2010 federal election campaign, Sullivan gained national media attention due to a gaffe where he criticised the father of a seven- year- old child with a disability for waiting two years on a Queensland Health waiting list. Sullivan apologised to the father and his family. Before entering federal politics, Sullivan was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. He was the Labor member for Caboolture from 1989 to 1998. He lost the seat to Bill Feldman, the One Nation candidate at the 1998 Queensland state election.

His work as a director includes\" Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\"( 1995),\" Mohabbatein\"( 2000),\" Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi\"( 2008) and\" Befikre\"( 2016). He is also the current Chairman of India's multi-national film, media and entertainment conglomerate Yash Raj Films( YRF). Chopra has written and produced a number of films under the banner such as\" Veer- Zaara\"( 2004),\" Fanaa\"( 2006),\" Band Baaja Baaraat\"( 2010),\" Jab Tak Hai Jaan\"( 2012), the\" Dhoom series\"( 2004, 2006& 2013),\" Sultan\"( 2016), the\" Tiger series\"( 2012& 2017) and\" War\"( 2019). He has broken away from typecast through production of off- beat films such as\" Kabul Express\"( 2006),\" Chak De! India\"( 2007),( 2009),\" Dum Laga Ke Haisha\"( 2015) and\" Hichki!\"( 2018), that do not necessarily fit into the realm of\" masala films\". Chopra is also the first to move towards a true film studio model through independent projects helmed by talent under his banner. Major post-production work of the company is now carried out of YRF Studios( co- founded by his ex-wife Payal Khanna), where Chopra serves as Chief Executive. He has produced ten films that have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of more than 200 crore, which is the most for an Indian film producer. In December 2009, Chopra fought a hostile acquisition bid by Walt Disney, valued upwards of 2500 crore, to remain and continue purely as a domestic entity aided by the Tata Sons. Apart from emerging as an equitable brand, his company has earned the status of a movie mogul through distribution networks spread across the globe, estimated to be net worth 7640 crore( FY17/18) by the NSE, thereby making it the biggest and most successful film production company in the history of Indian Cinema. Having denied him admission into the NSD as a young applicant, the Directorate of Film Festivals eventually honored him with the National Award for his achievements in 1995, 2005, 2007 and 2015. The Government of India appealed both Chopra and Mani Ratnam to focus on content created locally under its Make in India initiative, which was later followed by productions like\" Daawat- e- Ishq\"( 2014),\" Meri Pyaari Bindu\"( 2016),\" Sui- Dhaaga\"( 2018) and\" Jayeshbhai Jordaar\"( 2020) planned by his company. In June 2018, he was awarded membership into The Academy by the Producers Guild of America. Widely regarded as one of the most influential and powerful executives in Indian entertainment, Chopra has however rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Yash Chopra's son and the Chief Executive of Yash Raj Films. He has remained extremely media -shy and a passive individual, battling constant reports of an alleged dysthymic disorder throughout his three- decade career, resulting in very few public photos of him being in existence.\"",

He, according to William of Apulia, \"equalled in his virtues both the duke and his father.\" In 1071, Jordan briefly rebelled against his father with the support of his uncle, Ranulf. In 1078, while his father was besieging Naples with Robert Guiscard, Jordan and Robert, count of Loritello, were ravaging the Abruzzi, then papal territory. He, his father, and the duke were all excommunicated, when, suddenly, his father fell ill, retired to Capua, reconciled with the church, and died. Jordan, fearing to rule under the ban of the church, called off the siege of Naples and went to Rome to reconcile himself to Pope Gregory VII and rectify his relations with the church, of which his father had been both servant and protector. It appears that he intended to take up the position of his father \"vis-a-vis\" the papacy and to return to unfriendly relations with the duke of Apulia, for Gregory visited Capua a mere three months after Richard's death and Jordan, probably with papal prodding, began fomenting revolt in the Guiscard's lands. The revolt, the widely supported and well-organised, was ineffectual in really curbing Robert's influence and power. One of his chief advisors was the abbot of Montecassino, Desiderius of Benevento, who mediated between the prince and the Emperor Henry IV on the latter's descent into Italy (1081). Jordan forsook his erstwhile papal ally in exchange for an imperial investiture. Though Robert Guiscard and his brother Roger marched against him, Roger was recalled to Sicily and the expedition fell apart. In 1085, on Robert's death, Jordan supported Bohemond, the elder son, over Roger Borsa, the eldest by Sichelgaita, who was his own sister-in-law, he having married Gaitelgrima, another daughter of Prince Guaimar IV of Salerno. For the next three years, Bohemond held Apulia with the assistance of well-trained Capuan armies. In that same year, the pope died and the antipope Clement III continued to claim the papacy. In hopes of curbing the influence of Clement and united his interests with those of the papacy once again, he pressured the College of Cardinals to elect Desiderius of Montecassino as successor Gregory. At the same time, Roger Borsa freed the captured imperial prefect of Rome in opposition to the pretensions of Jordan and the Papal Curia, which had refused confirmation of Roger's archiepiscopal candidate for Salerno. The move backfired and Desiderius, under pressure from Jordan to accept, was elected pope as Victor III. With the aid of armies from Jordan and the Countess Matilda of Tuscany, Victor took the Vatican Hill from Clement on 1 July 1086. The pope remained lukewarm to his new job until Jordan suggested that only through decisive action could the good fortune of his beloved abbey of Montecassino be sustained. This led to an important synod at Benevento (1087), where Clement was excommunicated, lay investiture outlawed, and war with the Saracens of Africa declared. The remainder of Jordan's career was not notable and he died in November 1090 or 1091 in Piperna (near Terracina) and was buried in the monastery he had long supported, Montecassino, leaving a young son named Richard who succeeded him. His other sons, Robert and Jordan, would also succeed to the Capuan throne some day, and he left one unnamed daughter.\"",

The film was directed by Asif Kapadia and produced by James Gay- Rees, George Pank, and Paul Bell and co-produced by Krishwerkz Entertainment, On The Corner Films, Playmaker Films, and Universal Music, in association with Film4. The film covers Winehouse's life and her struggle with substance abuse, both before and after her career blossomed, and which eventually caused her death. In February 2015, a teaser trailer based on the life of Winehouse debuted at the pre-Grammy event in the build- up to the 2015 Grammy Awards. David Joseph, CEO of Universal Music UK, announced that the documentary entitled simply\" Amy\" would be released later that year. He further stated:\" About two years ago we decided to make a movie about her\u2014her career and her life. It's a very complicated and tender movie. It tackles lots of things about family and media, fame, addiction, but most importantly, it captures the very heart of what she was about, which is an amazing person and a true musical genius.\" The film was shown in the Midnight Screenings section at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival and received its UK premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. The film is distributed by the Altitude Film Distribution and A24, and was released theatrically on 3 July 2015 in the United Kingdom and the United States, and worldwide on 10 July; it received critical acclaim. \" Amy\" became the highest- grossing British documentary of all time, taking \u00a3 3 million at the box office in its first weekend. The film has received 33 nominations and has won a total of 30 film awards, including for Best European Documentary at the 28th European Film Awards, Best Documentary at the 69th British Academy Film Awards, Best Music Film at the 58th Grammy Awards, the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 88th Academy Awards and for Best Documentary at the 2016 MTV Movie Awards.

A member of the Democratic Party, Brown served as California Attorney General from 2007 to 2011. He was both the oldest and sixth-youngest governor of California as a consequence of the 28-year gap between his second and third terms. Upon completing his fourth term in office, Brown became the third longest-serving governor in United States history, serving 16 years and 7 days in office. Brown was born in San Francisco as the son of Bernice Layne Brown and Pat Brown, who served as the 32nd governor of California (1959\u20131967). After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley and Yale University, he began his political career as a member of the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees (1969\u20131971). He was elected to serve as the 23rd Secretary of State of California from 1971 to 1975. At 36, Brown was elected to his first term as governor of California in 1974, making him the youngest California governor in 111 years. In 1978, he won his second term. During and following his first governorship, Brown ran as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, 1980 and 1992. He declined to pursue a third term in 1982, instead making an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate that same year. After traveling abroad, he returned to California and served as Chairman of the California Democratic Party (1989\u20131991), attempting to run for the Senate once more in 1992. After six years out of politics, Brown returned to public life, serving as Mayor of Oakland (1999\u20132007), and then as Attorney General of California (2007\u20132011). He ran for his third and fourth terms as California governor in 2010 and 2014, his eligibility to do so having stemmed from California's constitutional grandfather clause. On October 7, 2013, he became the longest-serving chief executive in the history of California, surpassing Earl Warren.\"",

He also wrote about 500 cabaret songs, chamber music, and orchestral and choral works. His original name was actually Strauss, but for professional purposes he deliberately omitted the final 's', since he wished not to be associated with the musical Strauss family of Vienna. However, he did follow the advice of Johann Strauss II in 1898 about abandoning the prospective lure of writing waltzes for the more lucrative business of writing for the theatre. The son of a Jewish family, he studied music in Berlin under Max Bruch, and became an orchestral conductor, working at the \u00dcberbrettl cabaret. He went back to Vienna and began writing operettas, becoming a serious rival to Franz Leh\u00e1r. When Leh\u00e1r's popular \"The Merry Widow\" premiered in 1905, Straus was said to have remarked \"Das kann ich auch!\" (I can also do that!). In 1939, following the Nazi Anschluss, he fled to Paris, where he received the honour of a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, and then to Hollywood. After the war, he returned to Europe, and settled at Bad Ischl, where he died. His grave is in the Bad Ischl Friedhof. Straus' best-known works are \"Ein WalzertraumA Waltz Dream\"), and \"The Chocolate SoldierDer tapfere Soldat\"). The waltz arrangement from the former is probably his most enduring orchestral work. Among his most famous works is the theme from the 1950 film \"La Ronde\".\"",

Both parents were of Czech descent. They intended their son to study mining after high school, and pursure a career in the civil service. After the premature death of both his parents, Raymond studied at a commercial academy and trained as a banker. Raymond composed operetta music as well as copious pieces for films and Schlager, which were very successful in the 1920s and 1930s and were commonly heard being sung and whistled in the streets. He became world-famous with his 1925 composition  (\"I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg\"), and his pieces were considered to be very much in the typical style of the 1920s, especially  (\"I Saw Miss Helen Bathing\") or  (\"I Lost An Eyelash\"). Due to a weak heart, he spent his military service with a propaganda company which served the Belgrade military transmitter. After the war, he took a short break from the Salzburg Radio Orchestra to go to Hamburg, where he finished his last two operettas, \"Geliebte ManuelaBeloved Manuela\") and \"Flieder aus WienLilacs from Vienna\").

Through his mother he had royal descent from King Edward III, his great-grandfather, and from his father, he inherited, at an early age, the earldom of Stafford. By his marriage to a daughter of Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, Humphrey was related to the powerful Neville family and to many of the leading aristocratic houses of the time. He joined the English campaign in France with King Henry V in 1420 and following Henry V's death two years later he became a councillor for the new King, the nine-month-old Henry VI. Stafford acted as a peacemaker during the partisan, factional politics of the 1430s, when Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, vied with Cardinal Beaufort for political supremacy. Stafford also took part in the eventual arrest of Gloucester in 1447. Stafford returned to the French campaign during the 1430s and for his loyalty and years of service, he was elevated from Earl of Stafford to Duke of Buckingham. Around the same time, his mother died. As much of his estate\u2014as her dower\u2014had previously been in her hands, Humphrey went from having a reduced income in his early years to being one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in England. His lands stretched across much of the country, ranging from East Anglia to the Welsh border. Being such an important figure in the localities was not without its dangers and for some time he feuded violently with Sir Thomas Malory in the Midlands. After returning from France, Stafford remained in England for the rest of his life, serving King Henry. He acted as the King's bodyguard and chief negotiator during Jack Cade's rebellion of 1450, helping to suppress it. When the King's cousin, Richard, Duke of York, rebelled two years later, Stafford investigated York's followers. In 1453, the King became ill and sank into a catatonic state; law and order broke down further and when civil war began in 1455, Stafford fought for the King in the First Battle of St Albans which began the Wars of the Roses. Both were captured by the Yorkists and Stafford spent most of his final years attempting to mediate between the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions, the latter by now headed by Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou. Partly due to a feud with a leading Yorkist\u2014Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick\u2014Stafford eventually declared for King Henry and the Duke of York was defeated in 1459, driving York into exile. When the rebels returned the following year they attacked the royal army at Northampton. Acting as the King's personal guard in the ensuing struggle, Stafford was killed and the King was again taken prisoner. Stafford's eldest son had died of plague two years earlier and the Buckingham dukedom descended to Stafford's five-year-old grandson, Henry, a ward of the King until he came of age in 1473.\"",

A key figure in Australian postwar cinema, Burstall was instrumental in rebuilding the Australian film industry at a time when it had been effectively dead for over a decade. He created groundbreaking Australian films including\" StorkEnd PlayEliza Fraser The Last of the Knucklemen\" and the 1987 adaptation of the D.H. Lawrence novel\" Kangaroo\". Burstall's films featured early appearances by many legendary Australian actors including Jack Thompson, Bruce Spence, Jacki Weaver,\" Alvin\" star Graeme Blundell, John Waters and Judy Davis. Burstall's wife, Betty Burstall, an important figure in her own right, founded the pioneering La Mama Theatre in Melbourne in the late 1960s, with which Tim was involved. Speaking just after Burstall's death, David Williamson said that Burstall\" could n't stomach\" Australia's lack of a film industry. \" He was determined to do something about it and he had the energy and spirit to do it. ( He) was a very important cultural figure: highly intelligent, widely read, with a succinct and often highly controversial opinion on everything.\"\"",

Inspired by John Fox, Jr.'s 1908 novel of the same title, the song expresses the singer's love for his girl, June, who lives in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. The chorus is: It appears to have been first recorded in New York on 28 March 1913 by the Spanish-American tenor Manuel Romain and released in June of that year on issue number 1743 of the Edison Blue Amberol Record label. The song was featured in Laurel and Hardy's 1937 film \"Way Out West\". It was performed by Laurel and Hardy with The Avalon Boys and featured a section sung in deep bass by Chill Wills, lip-synced by Stan Laurel in the film, with the last line in falsetto (sung by Rosina Lawrence) after Ollie hit Stan on the head with a mallet. This stage routine was performed by actors Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly as part of the 2019 biographical film \"Stan & Ollie\". In 1975, at a time when Laurel and Hardy films were popular on British television, the UK branch of United Artists Records produced an album of dialogue and songs, \" Laurel & Hardy \u2013 The Golden Age Of Hollywood Comedy\", that included \"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\". Released as a single, the song reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart, thanks largely to being championed by disc jockey John Peel on his Radio 1 evening show. The song was also recorded by Vivian Stanshall and (as \"Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia\") by Tokyo Blade. The song is featured in the stage play \"The Trail Of The Lonesome Pine\", and is played during the opening credits of the 1936 film adaptation. Since 1964, the play has been performed in an outdoor theater in Big Stone Gap, Virginia, hometown of the novel's author: it was designated the \"official outdoor drama\" by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1994, and is now the sixth longest running outdoor drama in the United States.

One of the most popular and highest-paid Hindi film actresses in the 2000s, she has received several awards, including seven Filmfare Awards. Her roles have been cited in the media as a significant departure from previous screen portrayals of Indian women. Although Mukerji was born into the Mukherjee-Samarth family, in which her parents and relatives were members of the Indian film industry, she did not aspire to pursue a career in film. However, while still a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in her father's Bengali language film \"Biyer Phool\" (1996) and accepted a leading role in the 1996 social drama \"Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat\" on the insistence of her mother. She then began a full-time career in films and the 1998 action drama \"Ghulam\" was her first commercial success. She gained wider recognition for a supporting role in the romance \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" (1998). The year 2002 marked a turning point for Mukerji when she was cast by Yash Raj Films as the star of the drama \"Saathiya\". By 2004, Mukerji had established herself as a leading actress of Bollywood with roles in the romantic comedy \"Hum Tum\" and the dramas \"Yuva\" and \"Veer-Zaara\". She achieved further success for portraying a deaf, blind and mute woman in the acclaimed drama \"Black\" (2005), a con woman in \"Bunty Aur Babli\" (2005) and an unhappily married woman in \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" (2006). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. The semi-biographical thriller \"No One Killed Jessica\" (2011), in which she played a headstrong journalist, proved to be her first box office hit in four years. She followed it by starring in the successful thrillers  (2012) and \"Mardaani\" (2014), and the comedy-drama \"Hichki\" (2018). The latter emerged as her highest-grossing release. In addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show \"Dance Premier League\". Reticent to discuss her personal life in public, Mukerji is married to filmmaker Aditya Chopra, with whom she has a daughter.\"",

William was born in and died in D\u00fcsseldorf. He was the only son of John III, Duke of J\u00fclich- Cleves- Berg, and Maria, Duchess of J\u00fclich- Berg. William took over rule of his father's estates( the Duchy of Cleves and the County of Mark) upon his death in 1539. Despite his mother having lived until 1543, William also became the Duke of Berg and J\u00fclich and the Count of Ravensberg. From 1538 to 1543, William held the neighbouring Duchy of Guelders, as successor of his distant relatives, the Egmond dukes. Emperor Charles V claimed this duchy for himself as the dukes had sold their right of heritage, and William tried to hold on to it. He made a treaty with the King of France and married Jeanne d'Albret, and with this backup dared to challenge the Emperor. All too soon he learned that the French did not lift a finger to help him, and he was overwhelmed and had to surrender. In accordance with the Treaty of Venlo( 1543) that was the result of this war, Guelders and the County of Zutphen were transferred to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, combining them with the Habsburg Netherlands. William then tried to strengthen his inherited territories and launched an impressive development project for the most important cities. The three duchies all got new main fortresses as major strongpoints, for the older medieval fortifications had proved to be no match against the Imperial artillery. The cities of J\u00fclich, D\u00fcsseldorf and Orsoy became fortresses for the duchies of J\u00fclich, Berg and Cleves respectively, and J\u00fclich and D\u00fcsseldorf were turned into impressive residences. For this task, the renowned Italian architect Alessandro Pasqualini from Bologna was hired, who had already made some impressive display of his craft in the Netherlands. He made the plans for the fortifications and palaces, of which some traces still remain, especially at J\u00fclich where the citadel( built 1548- 1580) is a major landmark, with parts of the Renaissance palace still standing. William's sister Anne of Cleves was, for six months, the fourth wife of King Henry VIII of England. Through his daughter Marie Eleonore, he is ancestor of Marie Louise of Hesse- Kassel, wife of John William Friso, Prince of Orange therefore ancestor of all the current European monarchs.\"",

Chardon entered the noviciate in the Society of Jesus at Bordeaux on September 7, 1687. He studied at Pau in 1689 and 1690 and taught at the Jesuit college in La Rochelle from 1690 to 1695. He completed his studies at Poitiers in 1695 to 1699. He arrived in New France( Canada) in summer 1699 and learned amerindian languages until the end of that year. In 1700 he traveled to the Saguenay country. He soon was named missionary to the Ottawa. In the following year he joined the western mission headquartered at Mackinac, although he traveled widely. He visited the Foxes, Menominees, Mascoutens, Kickapoos, Ottawas, Potawatomis, and Miamis. In September 1701 he went to Green Bay( Baie- des- Puants) to aid The Venerable Henri Nouvel, who had been nearly forty years on the mission there and was nearly 80 years of age. In 1711 he was evangelizing the Miamis on the St. Joseph River, temporarily replacing Father Claude Aveneau, who was ill. In 1722 he replaced Father Pierre- Gabriel Marest as superior at Mackinac. According to Marest, he was a missionary full of zeal, with a rare talent for learning languages. He mastered nearly all the languages of the Indians he came in contact with. Chardon was the only priest on the old mission ground west of Lake Michigan for several years. He remained at Green Bay until 1728, when it was burned by Constant Le Marchand de Lignery on his return from his expedition against the Foxes. In 1733 Chardon was back at Montreal, and from 1735 to 1743 was listed as\" aged and infirm\" at Quebec.

He was the first Count of Monz\u00f3n, probably from before 939, certainly by 943, and he was Count of Castile in 943\u201345 in opposition to the deposed Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez. His family was known as the Banu Ansur(\" Banu Anshur\") or Ans\u00farez( Assuriz). The earliest reference to Ansur is found in a document dated 4 March 921, wherein he is named with his parents Fernando Ans\u00farez and Muniadonna in a donation in the vicinity of Burgos to San Pedro de Carde\u00f1a. His father is not mentioned after 929, but the date of his death is unknown. The leader of the Banu Ans\u00farez who allied with the Banu G\u00f3mez in rebellion against Ramiro in favour of his abdicated brother Alfonso IV in the spring of 932 may have already been Ansur. If so, he was already a count by that time. According to the\" Anales castellanos primeros\", he participated in the Battle of Simancas in 939, where he is one of only two participating counts named, the other being Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez of Castile. This indication of his importance and his high rank may also indicate that by then the county of Monz\u00f3n had already been created by Ramiro II for him. In July 941 Ramiro associated the counts of the Banu Ans\u00farez and G\u00f3mez families as well as Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez and Sancho Garc\u00e9s II of Pamplona with him in a peace treaty signed with the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba. Despite that Ansur bore the title\" count\" as early as 939, the earliest direct reference to the county of Monz\u00f3n is from a diploma of 26 December 943, which reads\" regnante Ranimiro in Obeto et in Legione et comite Assur Fredinandiz in Montson\"( Ramiro reigning in Oviedo and Le\u00f3n and Count Ansur Fern\u00e1ndez in Monz\u00f3n). By this act Ansur, his wife Guntroda, and their children \u2014 Fernando, Oveco, Mu\u00f1o, Nu\u00f1o, Gutierre, Gonzalo, and Teresa\u2014donated the village of Fuente Adrada near Sacramenia to the monastery of San Pedro de Carde\u00f1a. The gift was confirmed by a\" Domna Toda\", who signs right after the king. This may have been Toda of Navarre. A charter dated 1 August 937 refers to\" Assuri dominans Menduniae\"( Ansur ruling\" Mendunia\", a corruption of Monz\u00f3n), but there appears to be an error in the dating clause; the correct date is probably 1 March 947. After Ramiro deposed Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez in Castile, he appointed his own son, the future Sancho I, as count with Ansur acting as his\" regent\". By May 944 Sancho was in Burgos. There are four surviving charters from Ansur's brief reign in Castile; the earliest from November 943. The latest is dated to 1 December 945, though according to other sources Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez was reinstated in Castile on 22 April that year. Nonetheless, the reinstated Fern\u00e1n signed royal documents below Ansur, indicating a reversal of rank. Ansur's only known daughter, Teresa, married Ramiro II's son Sancho I and was the mother of Ramiro III. She inherited, and her son through her, the county of Monz\u00f3n after the death of Ansur's eldest son and successor, Fernando, in 978. In 976 Fernando boasted that his father had remained always faithful to his monarch and had served him with valour in a thousand battles.\"",

Patterson, son of Wimbledon champion Gerald Patterson, attended his father's school, Scotch College, Melbourne, from 1931 to 1934, and Geelong Grammar School from 1935 to 1941. He was one of a brace of new drivers that emerged after World War II, first appearing in the Australian Grand Prix in 1948 driving a stripped down MG TC. After improving the MG as far as he was able, he moved to a JAP powered Cooper Mk. V in 1953. Patterson used this to win his first national title, the 1954 Australian Hillclimb Championship. In the scorching heat of a Western Australian summer in 1957, Patterson stepped into Lex Davison's Ferrari 625 F1 as a relief driver, working together to defeat Stan Jones to win the 1957 Australian Grand Prix. A succession of grand prix Coopers followed. The biggest year of Patterson's career was 1961. Victories at Mount Panorama, Lowood, Caversham and a second at Longford saw Patterson dominate the 1961 Australian Drivers' Championship, scoring 51 points to Lex Davison's 15 to win the Gold Star. Patterson raced on for a few more years and took part in the inaugural Tasman Series in 1964, but after that Patterson stepped away from the sport as a driver, but stayed as an entrant, sponsor and team boss. Patterson Holden dealership Bill Patterson Motors supported several drivers over the following decades, open wheelers for the rest of the 1960s and on into the 1970s. In 1977 Patterson purchased touring car racing team, Team Brock which he ran for a year. Patterson's name continued to be seen in the sport into the 2000s in Speedway racing. Patterson died at Sandringham on 10 January 2010 at the age of 86.\"",

Aravindan. A mythological film, its story was adapted from C. N. Sreekantan Nair's play of the same name, which is a reworking of Valmiki's\" Ramayana\". The film interprets a story from the\" Uttara Kanda\" of the epic poem\" Ramayana\", where Rama sends his wife, Sita, to the jungle to satisfy his subjects. Sita is never actually seen in the film, but her virtual presence is compellingly evoked in the moods of the forest and the elements. The film retells the epic from a feminist perspective. It was shot in the interior tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh. The roles of the epic heroes are played by Rama Chenchu tribal people, who claim lineage to the mythological Rama. Director Aravindan interweaves the\" Samkhya Yoga\" philosophical concepts of\" PrakritiPurusha\" bonds throughout the film. The film was produced by K. Ravindran Nair under the banner of General Pictures. The film features an original score by classical musician Rajeev Taranath, cinematography by cinematographer- turned- director Shaji N. Karun, editing by Ramesan, and art direction by Artist Namboothiri. The film became a major critical success upon its release in 1977, although a few mainstream critics panned it. It is credited with being at the forefront of a trend towards independent filmmaking in South India. The film earned Aravindan the National Film Award for Best Direction.\"",

Batista initially rose to power as part of the 1933 Revolt of the Sergeants, which overthrew the provisional government of Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes y Quesada. He then appointed himself chief of the armed forces, with the rank of colonel, and effectively controlled the five-member \"pentarchy\" that functioned as the collective head of state. He maintained this control through a string of puppet presidents until 1940, when he was himself elected President of Cuba on a populist platform. He then instated the 1940 Constitution of Cuba and served until 1944. After finishing his term he lived in Florida, returning to Cuba to run for president in 1952. Facing certain electoral defeat, he led a military coup against President Carlos Pr\u00edo Socarr\u00e1s that preempted the election. Back in power, and receiving financial, military, and logistical support from the United States government, Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the right to strike. He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans. Eventually it reached the point where most of the sugar industry was in U.S. hands, and foreigners owned 70% of the arable land. As such, Batista's repressive government then began to systematically profit from the exploitation of Cuba's commercial interests, by negotiating lucrative relationships with both the American Mafia, who controlled the drug, gambling, and prostitution businesses in Havana, and with large U.S.-based multinational companies who were awarded lucrative contracts. To quell the growing discontent amongst the populace\u2014which was subsequently displayed through frequent student riots and demonstrations\u2014Batista established tighter censorship of the media, while also utilizing his Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities secret police to carry out wide-scale violence, torture and public executions. These murders mounted in 1957, as Fidel Castro gained more publicity and influence. Many people were killed, with estimates ranging from hundreds to about 20,000 people killed. Catalyzing the resistance to such tactics, for two years (December 1956 \u2013 December 1958) Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement and other nationalist rebelling elements led an urban and rural-based guerrilla uprising against Batista's government, which culminated in his eventual defeat by rebels under the command of Che Guevara at the Battle of Santa Clara on New Year's Day 1959. Batista immediately fled the island with an amassed personal fortune to the Dominican Republic, where strongman and previous military ally Rafael Trujillo held power. Batista eventually found political asylum in Oliveira Salazar's Portugal, where he first lived on the island of Madeira and then in Estoril, outside Lisbon. He was involved in business activities in Spain and was staying there in Guadalmina near Marbella at the time of his death from a heart attack on August 6, 1973.\"",

From 1909 to 1914, Abdullah sat in the Ottoman legislature, as deputy for Mecca, but allied with Britain during World War I. Between 1916 and 1918, he played a key role as architect and planner of the Great Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule that was led by his father Sharif Hussein. Abdullah personally led guerrilla raids on garrisons. Abdullah became emir to the Emirate of Transjordan in April 1921, which he established by his own initiative, and became king to its successor state, Jordan, after it gained its independence in 1948. Abdullah ruled until 1951 when he was assassinated in Jerusalem while attending Friday prayers at the entrance of the Al- Aqsa mosque by a Palestinian who feared that the King was going to make peace with Israel.

He was the first Count of Monz\u00f3n, probably from before 939, certainly by 943, and he was Count of Castile in 943\u201345 in opposition to the deposed Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez. His family was known as the Banu Ansur(\" Banu Anshur\") or Ans\u00farez( Assuriz). The earliest reference to Ansur is found in a document dated 4 March 921, wherein he is named with his parents Fernando Ans\u00farez and Muniadonna in a donation in the vicinity of Burgos to San Pedro de Carde\u00f1a. His father is not mentioned after 929, but the date of his death is unknown. The leader of the Banu Ans\u00farez who allied with the Banu G\u00f3mez in rebellion against Ramiro in favour of his abdicated brother Alfonso IV in the spring of 932 may have already been Ansur. If so, he was already a count by that time. According to the\" Anales castellanos primeros\", he participated in the Battle of Simancas in 939, where he is one of only two participating counts named, the other being Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez of Castile. This indication of his importance and his high rank may also indicate that by then the county of Monz\u00f3n had already been created by Ramiro II for him. In July 941 Ramiro associated the counts of the Banu Ans\u00farez and G\u00f3mez families as well as Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez and Sancho Garc\u00e9s II of Pamplona with him in a peace treaty signed with the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba. Despite that Ansur bore the title\" count\" as early as 939, the earliest direct reference to the county of Monz\u00f3n is from a diploma of 26 December 943, which reads\" regnante Ranimiro in Obeto et in Legione et comite Assur Fredinandiz in Montson\"( Ramiro reigning in Oviedo and Le\u00f3n and Count Ansur Fern\u00e1ndez in Monz\u00f3n). By this act Ansur, his wife Guntroda, and their children \u2014 Fernando, Oveco, Mu\u00f1o, Nu\u00f1o, Gutierre, Gonzalo, and Teresa\u2014donated the village of Fuente Adrada near Sacramenia to the monastery of San Pedro de Carde\u00f1a. The gift was confirmed by a\" Domna Toda\", who signs right after the king. This may have been Toda of Navarre. A charter dated 1 August 937 refers to\" Assuri dominans Menduniae\"( Ansur ruling\" Mendunia\", a corruption of Monz\u00f3n), but there appears to be an error in the dating clause; the correct date is probably 1 March 947. After Ramiro deposed Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez in Castile, he appointed his own son, the future Sancho I, as count with Ansur acting as his\" regent\". By May 944 Sancho was in Burgos. There are four surviving charters from Ansur's brief reign in Castile; the earliest from November 943. The latest is dated to 1 December 945, though according to other sources Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez was reinstated in Castile on 22 April that year. Nonetheless, the reinstated Fern\u00e1n signed royal documents below Ansur, indicating a reversal of rank. Ansur's only known daughter, Teresa, married Ramiro II's son Sancho I and was the mother of Ramiro III. She inherited, and her son through her, the county of Monz\u00f3n after the death of Ansur's eldest son and successor, Fernando, in 978. In 976 Fernando boasted that his father had remained always faithful to his monarch and had served him with valour in a thousand battles.\"",

He studied at the \"Colegio de los Padres Franceses\" and later moved to Paris, where he completed three years of law before returning to Chile. In 1867, Bulnes joined the Chilean Army as commander of a civic regiment organized and financed by himself. At the head of his regiment, he waged a continuous warfare against the Araucanian Indians in southern Chile, and in 1874 he joined the regular army ranks as a Sergeant major. He married Elena Calvo Cruchaga in 1877. Manuel Bulnes was elected a deputy for Mulch\u00e9n in 1879. At the beginning of the War of the Pacific, he organized a cavalry squadron that they named \"Escuadr\u00f3n de Carabineros de Yungay\", but the transport \"Rimac\" where they were traveling to the theater of operations was captured en route by the Peruvian Navy and they were interned as prisoners of war in the city of Tarma. Himself and his squadron were later freed via prisoner exchange, and they fought at the battles of Tacna, Chorrillos and Miraflores. After the war, he went in a government commission to Europe, where he was during the 1891 Chilean Civil War. He supported the congressional side and was rewarded with the promotion to Brigade General. He returned to Chile in 1894, where he became Secretary and later Chief of the Army General Staff.

Ramiro was thus raised at the Aragonese court, and was lord of Monz\u00f3n, in which he was succeeded by his eldest son, the future king Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre. Around 1098, Ramiro was married to Cristina Rodr\u00edguez daughter of Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar. Their children were:\"",

Unsupported at home following the death of her mother when she was nine years old, she ran away from home at thirteen. By sixteen she was working as a domestic servant for a woman who recognized her talent and drive, and paid to enroll her in the Art Institute of Chicago. There she studied with Lorado Taft and by 1887 she had advanced to become his studio and teaching assistant. In 1893, during the Columbian Exposition she was one of several women sculptors nicknamed the White Rabbits who helped produce some of the architectural sculpture that graced the exposition buildings. Aside from that she was awarded a commission to produce \"Illinois Welcoming the Nations\" for the Fair. The work was later cast in bronze and unveiled at the Illinois State Capitol, at which time Governor Altgeld was the main speaker. After successfully pursuing her career for a number of years, in 1906 she married painter William Wendt and moved to Los Angeles, California where she continued her success. In California she taught at the Otis Art Institute and, with her husband, was instrumental in the founding of the California Art Club in 1909, which was developed on the premise of allowing women and sculptors into the membership. Wendt was a member of the National Sculpture Society and exhibited and was featured in both the 1923 and 1929 Exhibitions and the resulting catalogues. She died in Laguna Beach on June 22 1924.\"",

Kim was born in Seoul during the colonial period, raised in Pyongyang, where he became interested in theater and cinema. In Korea after the end of World War II, he studied dentistry while becoming involved in the theater. During the Korean War, he made propaganda films for the United States Information Service. In 1955, he used discarded movie equipments to produce his first two films. With the success of these two films Kim formed his own production company and produced popular melodramas for the rest of the decade. Kim Ki-young's first expression of his mature style was in his\" The Housemaid\"( 1960), which featured a powerful\" femme fatale\" character. It is widely considered to be one of the best Korean films of all time. After a\" Golden Age\" during the 1960s, the 1970s were a low- point in the history of Korean cinema because of governmental censorship and a decrease in audience attendance. Nevertheless, working independently, Kim produced some of his most eccentric cinematic creations in this era. Films such as\" Insect Woman\"( 1972) and\" Iodo\"( 1977) were successful at the time and highly influential on the younger generations of South Korean filmmakers both at their time of release, and with their rediscovery years later. By the 1980s, Kim's popularity had gone into decline, and his output decreased in the second half of the decade. Neglected by the mainstream during much of the 1990s, Kim became a cult figure in South Korean film Internet forums in the early 1990s. Widespread international interest in his work was stimulated by a career retrospective at the 1997 Pusan International Film Festival. He was preparing a comeback film when he and his wife were killed in a house fire in 1998. The Berlin International Film Festival gave Kim a posthumous retrospective in 1998, and the French Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que screened 18 of Kim's films, some newly rediscovered and restored, in 2006. Through the efforts of the Korean Film Council( KOFIC), previously lost films by Kim Ki- young continue to be rediscovered and restored. Many current prominent South Korean filmmakers, including directors Im Sang- soo, Kim Ki-duk, Bong Joon- ho and Park Chan- wook, claim Kim Ki- young as an influence on their careers.\"",

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\"",

Van Dine, which had previously been made into a film in 1933, starring William Powell and Mary Astor. For this adaptation of the story, Vance is on international assignment from the United States government to investigate traffic in wartime aircraft designs. The original story dealt with art world double-dealing, but the solution to the mystery is the same in each film.\"",

He was the second son of Charles the Bald and brother of Louis the Stammerer. The younger Charles was appointed by his father, who had previously ruled as King of Aquitaine himself from 838, as a sop to Aquitainian separatism. The Aquitainians had previously rebelled against Charles the Bald, requesting from Louis the German that he send one of his sons to rule over them. Louis had sent his second son, Louis the Younger, prompting Charles the Bald to release his rival claimant to Aquitaine, Pippin II. Pippin succeeded in rallying the nobles to support himself and Charles the Bald against Louis the Younger, who was driven out. By October, however, Pippin lost his popularity with the still- rebellious Aquitainians, prompting Charles the Bald to appoint Charles the Child as King. Charles the Child was duly anointed at Limoges. Within a year, he had been replaced by the Aquitainians with Pippin II. These same then deposed Pippin and restored Charles the Child. Pippin was captured in 864 and imprisoned at Senlis, at which point he disappears from history. Unlike previous sub-kings of Aquitaine,( Louis the Pious, Pippin I, Pippin II), Charles the Child had no real authority at all. Before 840, the kingdom had been ruled in person by an autonomous king; Charles the Bald, however, after his accession as King of Western Francia, attempted to maintain power in Aquitaine. Consequently, Charles the Child, and his brother, Louis the Stammerer, did not rule in person, had no chancery, could issue no instruments; they were no longer empowered to bestow privileges, endow religious establishments, or dispose of royal property. All the rights of the region were invested in Charles the Bald, in whose absence the nobles of the Kingdom gathered power. Nonetheless, as Charles grew older, he began to exercise what little personal authority he could. For example, in 862 he chose and married a wife against the will of his father. The name of his wife is unknown, although she was apparently the widow of a count named Humbert. Charles the Bald reasserted his power over his son in 863, forcing the younger Charles to put away his wife and be loyal to his father. A year later, he was accidentally struck with a sword in the head by a member of his own hunting party in a mock combat, leading Ado of Vienne to say that\" Charles was dishonoured(\" dehonestatus\") by having suffered it\". The blow left him mentally incapacitated until his resultant death in 866. He died childless and was buried in Bourges.\"",

He was the only son of Louis, Prince of Piacenza, and his wife Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain. Born at the Royal Palace of Madrid at the court of his maternal grandfather King Charles IV of Spain, he spent his first years living at the Spanish court. In 1801, by the Treaty of Aranjuez, Charles became Crown Prince of Etruria, a newly created kingdom formed from territories of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Charles moved to Italy with his parents and in 1803, not yet four years old, he succeeded his father as King of Etruria under the name Charles Louis I. His mother Infanta Maria Luisa assumed the regency while Charles Louis' minority lasted. In 1807 Napoleon Bonaparte dissolved the kingdom of Etruria and Charles Louis and his mother took refuge in Spain. In May 1808 they were forced to leave Spain by Napoleon who arrested Charles Louis' mother in a convent in Rome. Between 1811 and 1814 Charles Louis was placed under the care of his grandfather, the deposed King Charles IV of Spain. After Napoleon's fall, in 1817, Infanta Maria Luisa became Duchess of Lucca in her own right and Charles Louis, age sixteen, became hereditary Prince of Lucca. In 1820 he married Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy. They were a mismatched couple and had only one surviving son. At his mother's death in 1824, Charles Louis became the reigning Duke of Lucca as Charles I. He had little interest in ruling. He left the duchy in the hands of his ministers and spent most of his time traveling around Europe. A liberal movement led him to abdicate Lucca in favor of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in October 1847 in exchange for financial compensation, as he wanted to retire to private life. Two months later, in December 1847, at the death of the former Empress Marie Louise, he succeeded her as the reigning Duke of Parma according to what had been stipulated by the Congress of Vienna. His reign in Parma as Duke Charles II was brief. He was ill- received by his new subjects and within a few months he was ousted by a revolution. He regained control of Parma under the protection of Austrian troops, but finally abdicated in favor of his son Charles III on 14 March 1849. His son was assassinated in 1854 and his grandson Robert I, the last reigning Duke of Parma, was deposed in 1860. In exile Charles Louis assumed the title of count of Villafranca. He spent the last years of his life mostly in France, dying at Nice on 16 April 1883.\"",

It is the first installment in the\" Fast& Furious\" franchise and stars Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, Chad Lindberg, Johnny Strong, Ted Levine, and Matt Schulze. \" The Fast and the Furious\" follows Brian O'Conner( Walker), an undercover cop tasked with discovering the identities of a group of unknown automobile hijackers led by Dominic Toretto( Diesel). Development for\" The Fast and the Furious\" arose after Cohen read a\" Vibe\" magazine article in 1998 titled\" Racer X\", which detailed the illegal street racing circuit operating within New York City. After contacting producer Neal H. Moritz, Moritz was able to present the script to Universal Studios, who greenlit\" The Fast and the Furious\" in 2000. Walker was the first actor to sign onto the project, while Diesel initially had to be persuaded to participate in the film, accepting after proposing several script changes. Principal photography began in Los Angeles in July 2000, with the majority of filming being done on location in Los Angeles and southern California, which ended in October 2000. \" The Fast and the Furious\" was released in the United States on June 22, 2001. The film was a commercial success, grossing over$ 200 million worldwide. It received mixed reviews, with praise for Walker and Diesel's performances, and the action sequences, but criticism of parts of the storyline including the ending. It was later re-released on June 22, 2016, to commemorate the film's fifteenth anniversary. \" The Fast and the Furious\" soon launched a media franchise and a series of seven sequels, starting with\" 2 Fast 2 Furious\" in 2003.\"",

She was the daughter of Fort\u00fan Garc\u00e9s of Pamplona and his wife Auria.

Her marriage created family ties between the Christian and Muslim ruling families of the Iberian peninsula, initially leading to close collaboration between the Christian House of \u00cd\u00f1iguez and the Muslim Umayyads.

Historians have generally viewed Emperor Gaozong as a weak ruler, inattentive to the business of the state and leaving such business to his powerful wife Empress Wu. During the first part of his reign, Tang territorial gains, which started with his father Emperor Taizong, continued, including the conquest of Baekje, Goguryeo, and the Western Turkic Khaganate, but throughout the 670s, much of those gains were lost to the Tibetan Empire, Silla, Khitan, and Balhae.

His later controversial 1960 film\" Peeping Tom\", while today considered a classic, and a contender as the first\" slasher\", was so vilified on first release that his career was seriously damaged. Many film- makers such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and George A. Romero have cited Powell as an influence. In 1981, he received the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award along with his partner Pressburger, the highest honour the British Film Academy can give a filmmaker.\"",

He was the second son of Charles the Bald and brother of Louis the Stammerer. The younger Charles was appointed by his father, who had previously ruled as King of Aquitaine himself from 838, as a sop to Aquitainian separatism. The Aquitainians had previously rebelled against Charles the Bald, requesting from Louis the German that he send one of his sons to rule over them. Louis had sent his second son, Louis the Younger, prompting Charles the Bald to release his rival claimant to Aquitaine, Pippin II. Pippin succeeded in rallying the nobles to support himself and Charles the Bald against Louis the Younger, who was driven out. By October, however, Pippin lost his popularity with the still- rebellious Aquitainians, prompting Charles the Bald to appoint Charles the Child as King. Charles the Child was duly anointed at Limoges. Within a year, he had been replaced by the Aquitainians with Pippin II. These same then deposed Pippin and restored Charles the Child. Pippin was captured in 864 and imprisoned at Senlis, at which point he disappears from history. Unlike previous sub-kings of Aquitaine,( Louis the Pious, Pippin I, Pippin II), Charles the Child had no real authority at all. Before 840, the kingdom had been ruled in person by an autonomous king; Charles the Bald, however, after his accession as King of Western Francia, attempted to maintain power in Aquitaine. Consequently, Charles the Child, and his brother, Louis the Stammerer, did not rule in person, had no chancery, could issue no instruments; they were no longer empowered to bestow privileges, endow religious establishments, or dispose of royal property. All the rights of the region were invested in Charles the Bald, in whose absence the nobles of the Kingdom gathered power. Nonetheless, as Charles grew older, he began to exercise what little personal authority he could. For example, in 862 he chose and married a wife against the will of his father. The name of his wife is unknown, although she was apparently the widow of a count named Humbert. Charles the Bald reasserted his power over his son in 863, forcing the younger Charles to put away his wife and be loyal to his father. A year later, he was accidentally struck with a sword in the head by a member of his own hunting party in a mock combat, leading Ado of Vienne to say that\" Charles was dishonoured(\" dehonestatus\") by having suffered it\". The blow left him mentally incapacitated until his resultant death in 866. He died childless and was buried in Bourges.\"",

He was involved in the chaos that surrounded the succession to Sultan Bayezid II (1481\u20131512).

When Ahmet was put to death by the victorious Selim, Prince Murad was subsequently given support by Ismail I as claimant to the throne. Ismail I wanted to use prince Murad to mobilize opposition against Selim I. In 1512, during Nur-Ali Khalifa's large-scale campaign in Anatolia, Murad joined his campaign, and even \"girded the Qizilbash crown\". According to information Selim I received from his spies (December 1512/January 1513), Ismail I allegedly wanted to conquer Anatolia, give the Rum beylerbeylik to Murad, while the rest of the territory would be ruled by the Qizilbash. Anyhow, when the Safavid support meant for Murad failed to materialize, the scheme was abandoned, and Murad migrated to the Safavid Empire where he was given asylum. He died at Kashan, or Isfahan. Ismail I's support to these rivals of Selim I formed one of the main \"casus belli\" that led to the decisive Battle of Chaldiran (1514).\"",

Hutchinson also made a small cameo in the classic New Zealand film as a dairy farmer. He produced other films and television commercials, most recently\" Home by Christmas\" in 2010. Hutchinson, the son of a Royal Air Force pilot, was born in England on 13 July 1941. He began his film career as a press officer for the Walt Disney Company's London office. An original drummer for the British band The Bo Street Runners, Hutchinson left the band to work for Disney full- time. His position in the band was filled by drummer Mick Fleetwood, who later formed Fleetwood Mac. Hutchinson next joined a production company owned by actor David Hemmings. While working with Hemmings, Hutchinson became friends with New Zealand cinematographer, Graeme Cowley. Huctinson and Cowley soon partnered in 1974 to form two film companies based in Wellington, New Zealand \u2013 Film Facilities, a film rental company, and their production company, Motion Pictures Limited. The duo hoped to profit from New Zealand's expanding film and television industries during the 1970s. Hutchinson originally met Geoff Murphy, who had already penned an early, handwritten screenplay for the film that would become\" Goodbye Pork Pie\" through his new production companies. Hutchinson and Cowley soon joined the production as co-producers. Together, Hucthinson, Murphy and Cowlet kept the production on a shoe- string budget of just NZ$ 450,000. Released in 1981,\" Goodbye Pork Pie\" became the first New Zealand- made film to recoup its original budget solely from domestic NZ box office sales. It also became the first New Zealand film to screen at the Cannes Film Festival. Cowley later focused on their Film Facilities rental division, while Nigel Hutchinson directed and produced television commercials. Hutchinson won several international awarded for his commercials, including a Gold Clio Award, a Gold Lion from the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and a Mobies award. His commercial portfolio featured Kiwi and international celebrities including Richard Briers, Richard Hadlee, Felicity Kendal, and Dennis Waterman. Nigel Hutchinson died at his home in Picton, on 23 March 2017, at the age of 75. He was survived by his wife of 42 years, Sue, and two children.\"",

In North America, it was also issued as the B-side of the album's lead single,\" Blow Away\", while in Britain and some other markets it was the B-side of the follow- up,\" Love Comes to Everyone\". The lyrics recall Harrison's experiences under the hallucinatory effects of magic mushrooms while holidaying on the Hawaiian island of Maui. The song title refers to Hana, a remote town on the island, and is a play on that of the 1920s ragtime tune\" Hard Hearted Hannah\". Harrison began writing the song in Los Angeles in response to Ted Templeman, a staff producer at Warner Bros. Records, suggesting he compose something in a similar style to his 1971 track\" Deep Blue\". He wrote the lyrics in Hawaii in February 1978, during the main writing period for\" George Harrison\", his first album in over two years. Recorded at Harrison's FPSHOT studio in Oxfordshire, the track features dobro, jazz piano, tuba and prominent chorus vocals, as well as voices and sounds captured in his local pub. The musical arrangement recalls the music hall tradition, while the composition's old- time qualities reflect Harrison's earliest influences from the pre-rock and roll era. The other musicians on the recording include Neil Larsen and Stevie Winwood. The song's lyrics employ, variously, psychedelic imagery, rhyming slang, humorous non sequiturs and John Keats- like symbolism. The song was well received by several music critics and revealed a comedic side of Harrison that was relatively unfamiliar to listeners. Author Simon Leng recognises\" Soft- Hearted Hana\" as the start of the\" Pythonization of Harrison's music\", referring to the Monty Python comedy troupe and Harrison's role as a film producer of British comedies such as\" Monty Python's Life of Brian\".\"",

He studied at the \"Colegio de los Padres Franceses\" and later moved to Paris, where he completed three years of law before returning to Chile. In 1867, Bulnes joined the Chilean Army as commander of a civic regiment organized and financed by himself. At the head of his regiment, he waged a continuous warfare against the Araucanian Indians in southern Chile, and in 1874 he joined the regular army ranks as a Sergeant major. He married Elena Calvo Cruchaga in 1877. Manuel Bulnes was elected a deputy for Mulch\u00e9n in 1879. At the beginning of the War of the Pacific, he organized a cavalry squadron that they named \"Escuadr\u00f3n de Carabineros de Yungay\", but the transport \"Rimac\" where they were traveling to the theater of operations was captured en route by the Peruvian Navy and they were interned as prisoners of war in the city of Tarma. Himself and his squadron were later freed via prisoner exchange, and they fought at the battles of Tacna, Chorrillos and Miraflores. After the war, he went in a government commission to Europe, where he was during the 1891 Chilean Civil War. He supported the congressional side and was rewarded with the promotion to Brigade General. He returned to Chile in 1894, where he became Secretary and later Chief of the Army General Staff. In 1896 he was named Minister of War and Navy by President Federico Err\u00e1zuriz Echaurren. In the short lapse while he held the post (from September 18 to November 26), he managed to regularized the army lists, giving legal equality to all who had ever served under the colors.

Following the death of his father, Al-Mustansir Billah, he was deposed by his brother, Ahmad al-Musta\u2018l\u012b but his son, Ali al-H\u0101d\u012b ibn Niz\u0101r, escaped to Alam\u016bt and took refuge with believers there, thereby continuing the Im\u0101mate.

There have been some incorrect theories that Imam Nizar came to Alamut. Thus the Egyptian period of Nizari Ismaili Imams came to an end.\"",

As the\" nisba\" in his name suggests, he was a Khazar by origin, and is said to have been a slave working in the kitchen of Sallam al- Abrash al- Khadim \u2014whence his nickname\" al- Tabbakhthe cook\" \u2014 before he was purchased as a\" ghul\u0101m\" by al- Mu'tasim in 815. He rose to become one of the senior commanders in al- Mu'tasim's\" Turkish\" guard, and participated in several expeditions such as the Sack of Amorium. Under al- Mu'tasim, he served as\" sahib al- shurta\" at Samarra, and became commander of the Caliph's personal guard. By the time of the accession of al- Wathiq in 842, he was, along with the Turk Ashinas, the\" mainstay of the caliphate\". Al- Wathiq named him governor of the Yemen in 843/ 4. After the death of Ashinas, in 844/ 5, he was named governor of Egypt, but he appointed Harthamah ibn al- Nadr al- Jabali there in his stead. Ya'qubi further reports that under al- Wathiq, he was appointed to the governorships of Khurasan, al- Sind, and the sub-provinces of the Tigris River. When al- Wathiq died unexpectedly in August 847, Itakh was one of the leading officials, along with the vizier Muhammad ibn al- Zayyat, the chief\" q\u0101d\u012b\", Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, his fellow Turkish general Wasif al- Turki, who assembled to determine his successor. Ibn al- Zayyat initially proposed al- Wathiq's son Muhammad( the future al- Muhtadi), but due to his youth he was passed over, and instead the council chose another of al- Mu'tasim's sons, the 26- year- old Ja'far, who became the caliph al- Mutawakkil. Unbeknownst to them, the new Caliph was resolved to destroy the coterie of his father's officials that controlled the state. Al- Mutawakkil's first target was the vizier Ibn al- Zayyat, against whom he harboured a deep grudge over the way he had disrespected him in the past. Thus, on 22 September 847, he sent Itakh to summon Ibn al- Zayyat as if for an audience. Instead, the vizier was brought to Itakh's residence, where he was placed under house arrest. His possessions were confiscated, and he was tortured to death. This was the apogee of Itakh's career: he combined the positions of chamberlain(\" \u1e25\u0101jib\"), head of the Caliph's personal guard, intendant of the palace, and head of the\" bar\u012bd\", the public post, which doubled as the government's intelligence network. In 848, however, he was persuaded to go to the pilgrimage, and laid down his powers, only to be arrested on his return. His possessions were confiscated \u2014 reportedly, in his house alone the Caliph's agents found one million gold dinars. He died of thirst in prison in 849.\"",

It is perhaps best known for starting the\" cannibal boom\" of Italian exploitation cinema during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Lenzi was probably trying to imitate the content of notorious Mondo cinema, which had gained considerable Grindhouse popularity since Gualtiero Jacopetti and Paolo Cavara made\" Mondo Cane\" in 1962, even though this film is fictional. Like\" Man from Deep River\", Mondo films often focus on exotic customs and locations, graphic violence, and animal cruelty. The film was mainly inspired by\" A Man Called Horse\", which also featured a white man who is incorporated into a tribe that originally held him captive. The title\" Man from Deep River\" is even supposed to echo the title\" A Man Called Horse\".\"",

Neugebauer was born in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany and is the son of Otto Neugebauer, an Austrian-American mathematician and historian of science, and Grete Bruck. After moving to the United States at age seven, he received his A.B. in physics from Cornell University in 1954 and his Ph.D. in physics from Caltech in 1960, with a thesis on the photoproduction of negative and positive pions from deuterium. During his military service with the U.S. Army he was stationed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and worked for the Ordnance Corps until 1962. He joined the Caltech faculty in 1962 as an assistant professor, becoming a full professor of physics in 1970. He was named Howard Hughes Professor in 1985 and Chairman of the Division of Physics, Math and Astronomy in 1988. At the time of his death, he was the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Physics, Emeritus and an adjunct faculty member of the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory. Neugebauer served as the director of the Palomar Observatory from 1980 to 1994. Neugebauer was active in infrared astronomy, and played a leading role in infrared studies of the planets. In addition\u2014and largely through his activities with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC)\u2014he led both ground- and space-based infrared studies of the stars, the Milky Way and other galaxies. Observations by him and his colleagues at Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories revealed thousands of infrared sources in the sky, and afforded the first infrared view of the galactic center. Together with Robert B. Leighton, he completed the Two-Micron Sky Survey, the first infrared survey of the sky, which cataloged more than 5,000 infrared sources. Together with Eric Becklin, he discovered the Becklin\u2013Neugebauer Object, an intense source of infrared radiation in the Orion Nebula that is one of the brightest objects in the sky at wavelengths less than 10 micrometres. Neugebauer played a role in the design and construction of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Among Neugebauer's numerous awards are two NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medals (1972, 1984), the 1985 Space Science Award of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the 1985 Richmyer Lecture Award, the 1986 Rumford Prize, the 1996 Henry Norris Russell Lectureship, the 1998 Herschel Medal, and the 2010 Bruce Medal. He was named California Scientist of the Year for 1986 by the California Museum of Science and Industry, and he was elected to the National Academy of the Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Royal Astronomical Society. Neugebauer was married to the geophysicist Marcia Neugebauer, a pioneer in solar wind research at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the two resided in Tucson, Arizona. He died on 26 September 2014 in Tucson, due to spinocerebellar ataxia.\"",

                "page_content": "\"Jordan I of Capua\tJordan I  (after 1046 \u2013 1091), count of Aversa and prince of Capua from 1078 to his death, was the eldest son and successor of Prince Richard I of Capua and Fressenda, a daughter of Tancred of Hauteville and his second wife, also named Fressenda, and the nephew of Robert Guiscard, duke of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily. He, according to William of Apulia, \"equalled in his virtues both the duke and his father.\" In 1071, Jordan briefly rebelled against his father with the support of his uncle, Ranulf. In 1078, while his father was besieging Naples with Robert Guiscard, Jordan and Robert, count of Loritello, were ravaging the Abruzzi, then papal territory. He, his father, and the duke were all excommunicated, when, suddenly, his father fell ill, retired to Capua, reconciled with the church, and died. Jordan, fearing to rule under the ban of the church, called off the siege of Naples and went to Rome to reconcile himself to Pope Gregory VII and rectify his relations with the church, of which his father had been both servant and protector. It appears that he intended to take up the position of his father \"vis-a-vis\" the papacy and to return to unfriendly relations with the duke of Apulia, for Gregory visited Capua a mere three months after Richard's death and Jordan, probably with papal prodding, began fomenting revolt in the Guiscard's lands. The revolt, the widely supported and well-organised, was ineffectual in really curbing Robert's influence and power. One of his chief advisors was the abbot of Montecassino, Desiderius of Benevento, who mediated between the prince and the Emperor Henry IV on the latter's descent into Italy (1081). Jordan forsook his erstwhile papal ally in exchange for an imperial investiture. Though Robert Guiscard and his brother Roger marched against him, Roger was recalled to Sicily and the expedition fell apart. In 1085, on Robert's death, Jordan supported Bohemond, the elder son, over Roger Borsa, the eldest by Sichelgaita, who was his own sister-in-law, he having married Gaitelgrima, another daughter of Prince Guaimar IV of Salerno. For the next three years, Bohemond held Apulia with the assistance of well-trained Capuan armies. In that same year, the pope died and the antipope Clement III continued to claim the papacy. In hopes of curbing the influence of Clement and united his interests with those of the papacy once again, he pressured the College of Cardinals to elect Desiderius of Montecassino as successor Gregory. At the same time, Roger Borsa freed the captured imperial prefect of Rome in opposition to the pretensions of Jordan and the Papal Curia, which had refused confirmation of Roger's archiepiscopal candidate for Salerno. The move backfired and Desiderius, under pressure from Jordan to accept, was elected pope as Victor III. With the aid of armies from Jordan and the Countess Matilda of Tuscany, Victor took the Vatican Hill from Clement on 1 July 1086. The pope remained lukewarm to his new job until Jordan suggested that only through decisive action could the good fortune of his beloved abbey of Montecassino be sustained. This led to an important synod at Benevento (1087), where Clement was excommunicated, lay investiture outlawed, and war with the Saracens of Africa declared. The remainder of Jordan's career was not notable and he died in November 1090 or 1091 in Piperna (near Terracina) and was buried in the monastery he had long supported, Montecassino, leaving a young son named Richard who succeeded him. His other sons, Robert and Jordan, would also succeed to the Capuan throne some day, and he left one unnamed daughter.\"",

As a young man, he entered the church. When his father died, his eldest brother, Lando, succeeded him. On the death of the bishop of Capua, Paulinus, Lando made Landulf bishop of the city. Lando died in 861 and his young son, Lando II was deposed only a few months later by Landulf's other elder brother, Pando. Pando too died soon thereafter( 862 or 863) and a succession crisis broke out. Pando's son Pandenulf was shoved aside and Landulf, though bishop, took the Capuan throne in 863. However, the other branches of the family refused to recognize the usurpation and began seizing much of the county for themselves, leaving Landulf II only in control of the town of Capua proper. Isolated, Landulf II invited Saracen mercenaries to ravage the lands of his familiars, a move which much alarmed his neighbors( including the pope). In 866, the deposed Pandenulf appealed to Emperor Louis II, then visiting Monte Cassino, to act against his uncle. The Emperor promptly besieged Capua and divested Landulf II, but instead of restoring Pandenulf, decided to pass the county of Capua over to the marquis Lambert I of Spoleto. This arrangement did not last long. In 871, Lambert was involved in a rebellion against Louis II orchestrated by Adelchis of Benevento. In the aftermath, Louis II deposed Lambert and restored Landulf II as count of Capua. As a condition, Landulf II swore off deploying Saracens in the county. Upon the death of Louis( 875), who had strictly enforced peace amongst the Christians of the Mezzogiorno, Landulf II allied himself with the Saracens, but in 877, Pope John VIII convinced him to ally himself to the papacy against the Muslims. He spent the next years defending the Amalfi Coast with his navy in return for tribute. Landulf II died in 879, undisputed count of Capua, and a succession crisis broke out again between his nephews Lando II( son of Lando), Pandenulf( son of Pando) and Lando III( son of Landenulf of Teano). In the chronicle of Erchempert, of whom he was a contemporary, Landulf II of Capua is the chief villain, portrayed as a dabbler in mysticism and black magic, Saracen ally and enemy of Christendom. Erchempert's portrayal of Landulf II was the inspiration for the character of evil duke and magician Klingsor in Wolfram von Eschenbach's medieval epic\" Parzival\". Eschenbach's epic was later translated into the famous nineteenth- century opera\" Parsifal\" by Richard Wagner. As American film director George Lucas is frequently said to have looked to\" Parsifal\" for inspiration in his creation of the\" Star Wars\" saga, Landulf II of Capua, via this long chain of association, is the closest historical source for the villainous Darth Vader.\"",

He was involved in the chaos that surrounded the succession to Sultan Bayezid II (1481\u20131512). Murad's father, Ahmet, the legal heir to the Ottoman throne, had fought against \u015eehzade Selim (later Selim I); during this struggle, Ahmet received support from King (\"Shah\") Ismail I (1501\u20131524) of the neighboring Safavid Empire. When Ahmet was put to death by the victorious Selim, Prince Murad was subsequently given support by Ismail I as claimant to the throne. Ismail I wanted to use prince Murad to mobilize opposition against Selim I. In 1512, during Nur-Ali Khalifa's large-scale campaign in Anatolia, Murad joined his campaign, and even \"girded the Qizilbash crown\". According to information Selim I received from his spies (December 1512/January 1513), Ismail I allegedly wanted to conquer Anatolia, give the Rum beylerbeylik to Murad, while the rest of the territory would be ruled by the Qizilbash. Anyhow, when the Safavid support meant for Murad failed to materialize, the scheme was abandoned, and Murad migrated to the Safavid Empire where he was given asylum. He died at Kashan, or Isfahan. Ismail I's support to these rivals of Selim I formed one of the main \"casus belli\" that led to the decisive Battle of Chaldiran (1514).\"",

In 860, al- Mutawakkil had named his three sons heirs and seemed to favour al- Muntasir. However, this appeared to change and al- Muntasir feared his father was going to move against him. With the implicit support of the Turkish faction of the army, he ordered the assassination of al- Mutawakkil which was carried out by a Turkish soldier on December 11, 861. The Turkish party then prevailed on al- Muntasir to remove his brothers from the succession, fearing revenge for the murder of their father. In their place, he was to appoint his son as heir- apparent. On April 27, 862 both brothers, al- Mu'ayyad and al- Mu'tazz, wrote a statement of abdication. Al- Muntasir's reign lasted for half a year and ended with his death of unknown causes on 862. After the death of al- Muntasir, the Turkish chiefs assembled in a council to select his successor. They did not want to elect al- Mu'ayyad or any of the brothers; so they elected al- Musta'in, another grandson of al- Mu'tasim. In 866, al- Musta'in was deposed and al- Mu'tazz came into power. Immediately upon becoming the new Caliph, al- Mu'tazz had the former Caliph al- Musta'in executed. The Turkish soldiery, after a brawl with the\" Maghariba\" troops, now turned their support to al- Mu'ayyad. Enraged by this predicament, the jealous Caliph had his brother, al- Mu'ayyad, being next heir to the throne, imprisoned along with another brother, Abu Ahmad, who had bravely led the troops in the late struggle on his side. The Turks attempted his release, but al- Mu'tazz, the more alarmed, resolved on his death. He was smothered in a downy robe( or, as others say, frozen in a bed of ice); and the body was then exposed before the Court, as if, being without mark of violence, he had died a natural death,( a transparent subterfuge). This period saw the rise of a legend that an Abbasid prince had converted to Christianity under the influence of Theodore of Edessa, taken the name\" John\" and been killed for his apostasy; Alexander Vasiliev speculates that Muayyad, who was killed in 866 by his brother Mu`tazz, may have been the convert. However, there is no Christian or Muslim record remotely associating Muayyad with Christianity or even, indeed, religious speculation. The motives for his murder seem to have been purely political; had he indeed converted, it would have given Mutazz an excuse to murder him for apostasy and been recorded.\"",

He is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Born and raised in New York City, Jay-Z first began his musical career after founding the record label Roc-A-Fella Records in 1995, and subsequently released his debut studio album \"Reasonable Doubt\" in 1996. The album was released to widespread critical success, and solidified his standing in the music industry. He has gone on to release twelve additional albums, which have all attained generally positive critical reception and commercial success, including \"The Blueprint\" (2001) and \"The Black Album\" (2003). Jay-Z has also released the full-length collaborative albums \"Watch the Throne\" (2011) and \"Everything Is Love\" (2018) with Kanye West and wife Beyonc\u00e9, respectively. Outside of his musical career, Jay-Z has also attained significant success and media attention for his career as a businessman. In 1999, he founded the clothing retailer Rocawear, and in 2003, he founded the luxury sports bar chain 40/40 Club. Both businesses have grown to become multi-million dollar corporations, and allowed Jay-Z to fund the start-up for the entertainment company Roc Nation, which was founded in 2008. In 2015, he acquired the tech company Aspiro, and took charge of their media streaming service Tidal, which has since become the world's third-largest online streaming company. Jay-Z is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with over 100 million records sold worldwide. He has won a total of 22 Grammy Awards, the most by a rapper, and holds the record for the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the \"Billboard\" 200, with 14. He has been ranked by \"Billboard\" and fellow music publication \"Rolling Stone\" as one of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2017, he became the first rapper to be honored into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 2018, received the commemorative \"Salute to Industry Icons\" award at the 60th Grammy Awards. In June 2019, Jay-Z officially became the first hip hop billionaire, making him the 3rd wealthiest African-American and the wealthiest American musician.\"",

The film is an Italian\u2013American venture produced by The Ladd Company, Embassy International Pictures, PSO Enterprises, and Rafran Cinematografica, and distributed by Warner Bros. Based on Harry Grey's novel \"The Hoods\", it chronicles the lives of best friends David \"Noodles\" Aaronson and Maximilian \"Max\" Bercovicz as they lead a group of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence as Jewish gangsters in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, together with the rise of mobsters in American society. It was the final film directed by Leone before his death five years later, and the first feature film he had directed in 13 years. It is also the third film of Leone's \"Once Upon a Time Trilogy\", which includes \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968) and \"Duck, You Sucker!\" (1971). The cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the film score by Ennio Morricone. Leone originally envisaged two three-hour films, then a single 269-minute (4 hours and 29 minutes) version, but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes). The American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes, and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone's involvement. The shortened version was a critical and commercial flop in the United States, and critics who had seen both versions harshly condemned the changes that were made. The original \"European cut\" has remained a critical favorite and frequently appears in lists of the greatest gangster films of all time.\"",

It stars Henry Fonda, cast against type, as the villain, Charles Bronson as his nemesis, Claudia Cardinale as a newly widowed homesteader, and Jason Robards as a bandit. The screenplay was written by Sergio Donati and Leone, from a story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci and Leone. The widescreen cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the acclaimed film score was by Ennio Morricone. After directing\" The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", Leone decided to retire from Westerns and desired to produce his film based on\" The Hoods\", which eventually became\" Once Upon a Time in America\". However, Leone accepted an offer from Paramount Pictures to provide access to Henry Fonda and to use a budget to produce another Western film. He recruited Bertolucci and Argento to devise the plot of the film in 1966, researching other Western films in the process. After Clint Eastwood turned down an offer to play the movie's protagonist, Bronson was offered the role. During production, Leone recruited Donati to rewrite the script due to concerns over time limitations. The original version by the director was 166 minutes( 2 hours and 46 minutes) when it was first released on 21 December 1968. This was the version that was to be shown in European cinemas and was a box office success. For the US release on 28 May 1969,\" Once Upon a Time in the West\" was edited down to 145 minutes( 2 hours and 25 minutes) by Paramount and was a financial flop. The film is the first installment in Leone's\" Once Upon a Time Trilogy\", followed by\" Duck, You Sucker!\" and\" Once Upon a Time in America\", though the films do not share any characters in common. In 2009, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being\" culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\"",

It was released in the US as\" Hell Raiders of the Deep\", in the United Kingdom as\" Human Torpedoes\" and in France and Belgium as\" Panique \u00e0 GibraltarPanic in Gibraltar\"). It was directed by Duilio Coletti and produced by Carlo Ponti and Luigi De Laurentiis, with a score by Nino Rota and a screenplay by Giuseppe Berto and Marcantonio Bragadin It included some real members of Decima Flottiglia MAS as support actors in the cast, including Luigi Ferraro, the inspiration for the film\" Mizar( Sabotaggio in mare)\". The main cast included Pierre Cressoy, Paolo Panelli and Paul M\u00fcller and a debut cameo by Tino Carraro. It was the first film appearance for Eleonora Rossi Drago, Riccardo Garrone and Mimmo Poli and also features Charles Fawcett, one of the few actors to appear in more than one Coletti film. The events are a little modified and presented in a more favorable way for the Royal Navy. Namely, the damaging of HMS\" Valiant\" is just mentioned in a statement at the end of the movie, the two Italians are evacuated from the room under sea level before the explosion while in reality they had been placed there again after Durand De La Penne had told Morgan about the next explosion, and lastly the news suppression about the ships' damage is presented as much more effective than it was( actually after only a few days the Italian command was informed about the result of the operation).\"",

Hutchinson also made a small cameo in the classic New Zealand film as a dairy farmer. He produced other films and television commercials, most recently\" Home by Christmas\" in 2010. Hutchinson, the son of a Royal Air Force pilot, was born in England on 13 July 1941. He began his film career as a press officer for the Walt Disney Company's London office. An original drummer for the British band The Bo Street Runners, Hutchinson left the band to work for Disney full- time. His position in the band was filled by drummer Mick Fleetwood, who later formed Fleetwood Mac. Hutchinson next joined a production company owned by actor David Hemmings. While working with Hemmings, Hutchinson became friends with New Zealand cinematographer, Graeme Cowley. Huctinson and Cowley soon partnered in 1974 to form two film companies based in Wellington, New Zealand \u2013 Film Facilities, a film rental company, and their production company, Motion Pictures Limited. The duo hoped to profit from New Zealand's expanding film and television industries during the 1970s. Hutchinson originally met Geoff Murphy, who had already penned an early, handwritten screenplay for the film that would become\" Goodbye Pork Pie\" through his new production companies. Hutchinson and Cowley soon joined the production as co-producers. Together, Hucthinson, Murphy and Cowlet kept the production on a shoe- string budget of just NZ$ 450,000. Released in 1981,\" Goodbye Pork Pie\" became the first New Zealand- made film to recoup its original budget solely from domestic NZ box office sales. It also became the first New Zealand film to screen at the Cannes Film Festival. Cowley later focused on their Film Facilities rental division, while Nigel Hutchinson directed and produced television commercials. Hutchinson won several international awarded for his commercials, including a Gold Clio Award, a Gold Lion from the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and a Mobies award. His commercial portfolio featured Kiwi and international celebrities including Richard Briers, Richard Hadlee, Felicity Kendal, and Dennis Waterman. Nigel Hutchinson died at his home in Picton, on 23 March 2017, at the age of 75. He was survived by his wife of 42 years, Sue, and two children.\"",

She served one term in the United States House of Representatives, winning an at-large seat in Illinois in 1928. She gave up the chance to run for re-election to seek a United States Senate seat from Illinois. She defeated the incumbent, Senator Charles S. Deneen, in the Republican primary, becoming the first female Senate candidate for a major party. McCormick lost the general election. A decade later, she became the first woman to manage a presidential campaign, although her candidate, Thomas E. Dewey, failed to capture his party's nomination. Politics was a part of McCormick's life from an early age. She was the daughter of Mark Hanna, a Senator and politician who was instrumental in the election of President William McKinley. McCormick learned politics by watching her father, and put those lessons to use fighting for causes such as women's suffrage and improved working conditions for women. McCormick was instrumental in passing a partial suffrage law in Illinois in 1913, allowing women to vote in municipal and Presidential elections. She also married two politicians, Senator Joseph Medill McCormick and Congressman Albert Gallatin Simms. McCormick's endeavors were not limited to politics. Throughout her life, she maintained an interest in agriculture. She owned and operated ranches in Illinois, New Mexico, and Colorado.

His low- budget genre films, known for their distinctive visual flair and technical ingenuity, feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality, and the destructive capacity of human nature. Born to sculptor, cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava, the younger Bava followed his father into the film industry, and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy's foremost cameramen, lighting and providing the special effects for such films as\" Hercules\"( 1958) and its sequel\" Hercules Unchained\"( 1959)( each were lampooned on\" Mystery Science Theater 3000\"). During the late 1950s, his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers, including\" I Vampiri\"( 1957)( the first Italian horror film of the sound era),\" The Day the Sky Exploded\"( 1958)( the first Italian science fiction film),\" Caltiki \u2013 The Immortal Monster\"( 1959) and\" The Giant of Marathon\"( 1959). Although most of Bava's films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release, many of them would eventually find acclaim as cult classics, with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock. Several of them have been noted for their revolutionary impact on their respective genres:\" Black Sunday\"( 1960), his official directorial debut, was the forerunner of the Italian gothic horror film cycle;\" The Girl Who Knew Too Much\"( 1963) is considered to be the first giallo film;\" Kill, Baby, Kill\"( 1966) heavily influenced the iconography of modern J-Horror;\" Roy Colt& Winchester Jack\"( 1970) is regarded as one of the earliest self- parodying Spaghetti Westerns;\" Four Times That Night\"( 1971) was an early Italian sex comedy; and\" A Bay of Blood\"( 1971) was a precursor to slasher films.

Despite his reputation as a talented artist during his lifetime, Bava's shy, self- deprecating demeanour prevented him from taking advantage of opportunities that would have furthered his international standing within the film industry, and he turned down multiple opportunities to work in Hollywood. Among the filmmakers Bava and his work have influenced include Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Federico Fellini, John Carpenter, Nicolas Winding Refn, Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton, Joe Dante, John Landis, Francis Ford Coppola, Roger Corman, Edgar Wright, Jennifer Kent and Quentin Tarantino. His son and frequent assistant director, Lamberto Bava, later became a noted fantasy and horror film director in his own right.\"",

According to Fleischer, Berke eventually pestered RKO executives enough to be assigned an A picture with a long shooting schedule and stars and he still shot it in twelve days.\"",

Badi al-Zaman was appointed as the governor of Sistan in 1557, and married Pari Khan Khanum (who was at that time 10 years old).

According to the other historians, however, Pari Khan Khanum was only engaged to Badi al-Zaman, which according to Gholsorkhi seems more believable.

A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence through his formation of a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers (\"ghilm\u0101n\"). This proved useful to his half-brother, Caliph al-Ma'mun, who employed al-Mu'tasim and his Turkish guard to counterbalance other powerful interest groups in the state, as well as employing them in campaigns against rebels and the Byzantine Empire. When al-Ma'mun died unexpectedly on campaign in August 833, al-Mu'tasim was thus well placed to succeed him, overriding the claims of al-Ma'mun's son al-Abbas. Al-Mu'tasim continued many of his brother's policies, such as the partnership with the Tahirids, who ruled Khurasan and Baghdad on behalf of the Abbasids. With the support of the powerful chief \"q\u0101d\u012b\", Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, he continued to implement the rationalist Islamic doctrine of Mu'tazilism and the persecution of its opponents through the inquisition (\"mi\u1e25na\"). Although not personally interested in literary pursuits, al-Mu'tasim also nurtured the scientific renaissance begun under al-Ma'mun. In other ways, his reign marks a departure and a watershed moment in Islamic history, with the creation of a new regime centred on the military, and particularly his Turkish guard. In 836, a new capital was established at Samarra to symbolize this new regime and remove it from the restive populace of Baghdad. The power of the caliphal government was increased by centralizing measures that reduced the power of provincial governors in favour of a small group of senior civil and military officials in Samarra, and the fiscal apparatus of the state was more and more dedicated to the maintenance of the professional army, which was dominated by Turks. The Arab and Iranian elites that had played a major role in the early period of the Abbasid state were increasingly marginalized, and an abortive conspiracy against al-Mu'tasim in favour of al-Abbas in 838 resulted in a widespread purge of their ranks. This strengthened the position of the Turks and their principal leaders, Ashinas, Wasif, Itakh, and Bugha. Another prominent member of al-Mu'tasim's inner circle, the prince of Ushrusana, al-Afshin, fell afoul of his enemies at court and was overthrown and killed in 840/1. The rise of the Turks would eventually result in the troubles of the \"Anarchy at Samarra\" and lead to the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the \"ghul\u0101m\"-based system inaugurated by al-Mu'tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world. Al-Mu'tasim's reign was marked by continuous warfare. The two major internal campaigns of the reign were against the long-running Khurramite uprising of Babak Khorramdin in Adharbayjan, which was suppressed by al-Afshin in 835\u2013837, and against Mazyar, the autonomous ruler of Tabaristan, who had clashed with the Tahirids and risen up in revolt. While his generals led the fight against internal rebellions, al-Mu'tasim himself led the sole major external campaign of the period, in 838 against the Byzantine Empire. His armies defeated Emperor Theophilos and sacked the city of Amorium. The Amorium campaign was widely celebrated, and became a cornerstone of caliphal propaganda, cementing al-Mu'tasim's reputation as a warrior-caliph.\"",

They captured a large number of Ottoman prisoners and two guns and destroyed the water towers, but suffered 17 casualties in the operation. Buxton's two companies of Imperial Camel Corps continued on towards Amman, where they hoped to destroy the main bridge.

She was \"comtesse de S\u00e9gur\" by marriage, and a courtier of Louis XV, her cousin. Her mother was Christine Antoinette \"Charlotte\" Desmares (1682\u20131753), a beautiful actress (\"tragedienne\") of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais who was painted by Jean-Baptiste Santerre. Charlotte Desmares was a niece of Marie Champmesl\u00e9 and one of the many mistresses of the regent, Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, around 1702, the year their daughter was born. Also born in 1702 was another illegitimate child of the duke, Jean Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, by a lady-in-waiting, Madame d'Argenton. Ang\u00e9lique's half-brother was legitimised in 1706, whereas Ang\u00e9lique was neither acknowledged nor recognized, although Madame du Prat erroneously states in her memoirs that she was recognized on 22 April 1722, the same day as the abb\u00e9 de Saint-Albin, another illegitimate son of the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans by his mistress Florence Pellerin. Madame de S\u00e9gur belonged to the inner circle of Louis XV's intimates. She is described as \"fresh, white, well made, strong and intoxicating\". She married Henri Fran\u00e7ois, comte de S\u00e9gur (1689\u20131751) at Gagny or Paris on 10 or 12 September 1718. He was the son Henri Joseph, comte de S\u00e9gur and Claude \u00c9lisabeth Binet. Called \"le beau S\u00e9gurthe handsome S\u00e9gur\"), her husband had been \"master of the wardrobe\" of the Regent (\"ma\u00eetre de la garderobe du R\u00e9gent\"). He lived in an \"h\u00f4tel\" in Passy, Paris on a beautiful ten-acre property, which later passed to the Duchess of Valentinois and was named \"H\u00f4tel de Valentinois\" after her. (The property is famous for being the residence of Benjamin Franklin for nearly ten years.) They had at least five children: Ang\u00e9lique died in Paris 1785 at 83 years of age, and was buried at the \u00c9glise Saint-Eustache, Paris.\"",

It is perhaps best known for starting the\" cannibal boom\" of Italian exploitation cinema during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Only seven when his father died, Thomas became Count of Perche under the regency of his mother and her new husband Enguerrand III, Lord of Coucy. In 1216, the English barons rebelled in the First Barons' War against John Lackland, and offered the English crown to Louis VIII the Lion, King of France. The death of King John ended this arrangement and the crown went to Henry III, John's son. In the end, Louis VIII renounced the English crown, but in the interim fought the forces of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. In the decisive Battle of Lincoln (1217), Thomas, the commander of the French forces, was killed. Thomas married H\u00e9lisende Rethel, daughter of Hugh II, Count of Rethel, and Felicitas, daughter of Simon of Broyes. This union produced no children. His widow remarried Garnier de Tra\u00eenel, Seigneur de Marigny. Following Thomas' death in 1217, King Philip II of France would gain control of the castles of Moulins-la-Marche, Bonsmoulin, and Belleme, which had been contested since 1182.
